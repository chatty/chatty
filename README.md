Chatty
======

Chatty is a Twitch Chat Client for Desktop written in Java featuring many
Twitch specific features.

* E-Mail: chattyclient@gmail.com
* Twitter: @ChattyClient (https://twitter.com/ChattyClient)

I learned about most of the Java techniques and APIs used in this during
development, so many things won't be designed ideally. I also never
released such a project as opensource before, so if I missed anything or
didn't adhere to some license correctly, please tell me.

Notes on building the program yourself
======================================

The project is compiled using Gradle. Once you've checked it out, you can run
`gradlew build` to compile and run the tests, and `gradlew release` to package
the release artifacts.

If you have Hotkey Support enabled (Windows only), you need to include the
JIntellitype32.dll or the JIntellitype64.dll for the 32/64bit versions of Java
respectively (but always renamed to JIntellitype.dll).

In Chatty.java you should set your own client id which you get from Twitch. You
may also want to disable the Version Checker depending on how you will distribute
the compiled program. See the comments in Chatty.java for more information.
