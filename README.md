I learned about most of the Java techniques and APIs used in this during
development, so many things won't be designed ideally. I also never
released such a project as opensource before, so if I missed anything or
didn't adhere to some license correctly, please tell me.

and more information on the features.

Contributions
=============

Contributions to Chatty under the terms of the GPLv3 License (or compatible) are
welcome.

If you're contributing code that you didn't write yourself, make sure to adhere
to whatever license terms it is under (like retaining copyright notices) and to
detail that in the Pull Request.

Obviously, I won't be able to accept all contributions, for example I may
already be working on something similar. If you plan to put more than a little
effort into a Pull Request, consider asking first if what you're doing has a
chance of being added.

Notes on building the program yourself
======================================

The project is compiled using Gradle. Once you've checked it out, you can run
`gradlew build` to compile and run the tests, and `gradlew release` to package
the release artifacts.

If you have Hotkey Support enabled (Windows only), you need to include the
JIntellitype32.dll or the JIntellitype64.dll for the 32/64bit versions of Java
respectively (but always renamed to JIntellitype.dll). If you use the release
task mentioned above, several different zip versions are created for this.

In Chatty.java you should set your own client id which you get from Twitch. You
may also want to disable the Version Checker depending on how you will distribute
the compiled program. See the comments in Chatty.java for more information.

Windows Standalone Bundle
-------------------------

You can create a standalone Windows version (including a JRE) using the
javapackager program included in the JDK. Use the `releaseWindows` task to
build both the regular zip files and the standalone version, or the
`windowsZip` task to just build the standalone version.

You must specify the path to the javapackager program like this:
`gradlew windowsZip -PjavapackagerPath="<path_to>/javapackager.exe"`

You may also specify the path to the JRE to bundle using the `-PjrePath`
parameter, otherwise it will use the default JRE of the system.

Currently the build includes the JIntellitype32.dll, so you may have to
exchange that file if you bundle a 64bit version of Java.
