Requirements
------------

This is a Java program, so you need to have the JRE 8 (Java Runtime Environment) or later installed.

Installation
------------

No real need for installation, just extract the Chatty_*.zip file into a
folder and start the Chatty.jar with Java.

If you want to use Global Hotkey support for Windows, you also need the JIntellitype.dll in the
folder you execute Chatty from.

Starting Chatty
---------------

You may be able to just double-click the Chatty.jar. If it asks you to select a program
to open it with, choose Java.

You can also create a shortcut to start Chatty, when creating the shortcut use:

	javaw -jar "<Path to Chatty.jar>"

For example:

	javaw -jar "C:\Program Files (x86)\Chatty\Chatty.jar"

This also allows you to add launch options, for example defining the channel to join:

	javaw -jar "C:\Program Files (x86)\Chatty\Chatty.jar" -channel twitch

If you create a shortcut like this, make sure you set the working directory correctly
(specified in a field labeled "Run in" or similar). This can be important for some features.

You may also need to specify the full path to Java if just "javaw -jar" doesn't work, for
example:

	C:\Windows\System32\javaw.exe -jar "C:\Program Files (x86)\Chatty\Chatty.jar"

Settings
--------

Settings are saved in a ".chatty" subfolder of your user directory by default. You can
find out where the settings are saved to by entering "/dir" in Chatty.

You can change this location to your current working directory by using the "-cd" launch
option or to a specified directory by using the "-d <dir>" launch option (the dir has to
exist already).

Logfile
-------

There is a /debuglogs subfolder in the settings directory which contains a
number of different debug logs. There is more information on them in the help.

More Help
---------

There is more help available in Chatty under <Help - About/Help> and online on the
Chatty website as mentioned at the beginning of this file.

Licence
-------

Chatty is released under the GPLv3. See the in-app help and the GitHub repository
for more detailed information.
