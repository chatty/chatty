    <h1><a name="top">Memory Usage</a></h1>
    
    <p>
        <a href="#restrict">Restrict Memory Usage</a> |
        <a href="#error">OutOfMemoryError</a>
    </p>
    <p>The programs memory is managed by Java, which means Java allocates a
        certain amount of memory which is then filled up with data of the program
        and once Java decides so, it cleans up data that is not used anymore
        (Garbage Collection). This leads to the actual memory usage going up and
        down constantly, while the allocated memory mostly stays the same. So
        even if only 50 MB are filled with data by the program <em>at the time</em>, Java may
        still have 200 MB reserved to optimize Gargabe Collection. Thus, the memory usage in e.g. the Task Manager
        may not reflect what the program actually <em>requires</em>, just how
        much Java uses.</p>
    
    <p>Use the <code>/appinfo</code> command in Chatty to get some information
        about the current memory usage.</p>
    
    <p>A typical memory usage pattern, which can change over time as the program
        is running while Java optimizes Gargabe Collection:<br />

    <h2><a name="restrict">Restrict Memory Usage</a></h2>
    <p>You can <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1493913/how-to-set-the-maximum-memory-usage-for-jvm">restrict</a> how much memory Java is allowed to use by specifying
        commandline parameters for Java. <a href="help-guide_create_shortcut.html">Create a shortcut</a>
        and add the appropriate parameter after the <code>javaw.exe</code> but
        before the <code>-jar</code> parameter.</p>
    
    <p>For example to restrict memory to 100 MB: <code>javaw -Xmx100M -jar "D:\Chatty\Chatty.jar"</code></p>
    
    <h2><a name="error">OutOfMemoryError</a></h2>
    <p>If you get an OutOfMemoryError then Java ran out of memory. This can
        either be because it simply can't allocate enough memory (at least 100 MB is recommended)
        or there is a bug that prevents it from cleaning up memory that is not
        actually used anymore. These kinds of bugs are pretty difficult to track
        down though, especially if they only occur somewhat randomly.</p>
