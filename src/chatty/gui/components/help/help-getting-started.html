    <h1><a name="top">Getting Started</a></h1>
    <p>This guide will help you with installing Chatty and getting familiar with
        some of it's features.</p>
    
    <h2>Download &amp; Installation</h2>
    <p>From the <a href="https://chatty.github.io/#download">Chatty Website</a>
        you can download either a .zip-Archive which you need to extract or an
        Installer which will guide you through the installation.</p>
    
    <p>How you start Chatty depends on the version you downloaded and your OS,
        but usually you'd double-click on either the <code>Chatty.jar</code> or
        <code>Chatty.exe</code>. (See <a href="help-troubleshooting.html#start">the help</a>
        if Chatty won't start.)</p>
    
    <h3>Update Chatty</h3>
    <p>If you want to update from an already installed older version of Chatty
        then you may be able to simply use the built-in update function which
        downloads the most recent installer and guides you through the update
        process. If you update manually, then simply extract the .zip or install
        the Installer into the same folder Chatty is already in and overwrite
        the old files.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you install Chatty into the same folder or not, your settings
        are by default <a href="help-guide_folders.html">stored separately</a>
        and should stay the same when you upgrade to a new version.</p>
    
    <p>When you start a new version for the first time it will open the
        <a href="help-releases.html">Release Information</a>, which may contain
        information about changes that could require your attention.</p>
        
    <p><em>Note:</em> If you downgrade to an <em>older</em> version of Chatty,
        some settings (that the older version didn't have yet) may be lost.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating a login</h2>
    <p>If you are starting Chatty for the first time, you will have to request
        login data from Twitch so Chatty can connect to chat on your behalf
        (among other things).</p>
    
    <p>In the <code>Connect</code>-dialog, click on <code>Configure Account</code>
        and then <code>Request login data</code> and simply follow the instructions.
    Once you successfully created the login, close the dialog until you get back
    to the <code>Connect</code>-dialog. (There is a <a href="help-guide2.html">Guide</a> on what to do
    when getting login data fails.)</p>
    
    <h2>Join channels (and leave channels)</h2>
    <p>In the <code>Connect</code>-dialog enter the name of the channel you want
        to join in the <code>Channel:</code> input box. The name of the channel
    is the same as the name of the stream. You can enter more than one channel
    name to join by seperating them with a comma. To connect simply press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    or click on <code>Connect</code>. After connecting, it will automatically join
    the channels you specified.</p>
    
    <p>Even after connecting you can join additional channels via <code>Channels - Join Channel</code>
        or entering the command <code>/join &lt;channelname&gt;</code> in the inputbox
        (e.g. <code>/join joshimuz</code>).</p>
    
    <p>You can leave channels by right-clicking anywhere in the channel and
        selecting <code>Close Channel</code> from the context menu or right-clicking
    on the channel's tab (only available if there is more than one channel) and
    selecting <code>Close</code> from the context menu.</p>
    
    <h2>Chatting and Moderating</h2>
    <h3>Inputbox Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="help.html#nickCompletion">TAB-Completion</a>: Enter the
            beginning of a name in chat and press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to auto-complete
            the name. Also works for things like commands or Emoji (although
            Twitch Emotes require <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> by default).</li>
        <li>Press the <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> key to go back to
            <a href="help.html#inputHistory">previous messages you sent</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Moderating</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Twitch <a href="help-builtin_commands.html#commands-chat">chat commands</a> like
            <code>/ban</code>, <code>/timeout</code>, <code>/subscribers</code>
            (<em>Hint:</em> Use TAB-Completion).</li>
        <li>Click on a name in chat to open User Dialog, to view recent messages
            and use moderation buttons (customizable via
            <a href="help-custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Also check out the options to <a href="help.html#pausechat">pause chat</a>
        and timing out users via <a href="help.html#userselection">shortcuts only</a>.</p>
    
    <p><img src="userdialog.jpg" alt="User Dialog with moderation buttons" /></p>
    
    <h2>Information about the current stream</h2>
    <p>Chatty regulary requests information about the current stream, which is
        displayed in the titlebar and the <code>Channel Info</code>-dialog.</p>
    
    <p><img src="0_4_overview_top.png" alt="Chatty Title and Tabs" /></p>
    
    <p>You can open the <code><a href="help.html#channelinfo">Channel Info</a></code> via the <code>View</code>-menu
    or the channel context menu (right-click anywhere on the channel). The
    <code>Channel Info</code> contains the current title/game but also a history
    of the Viewercount and previous title/games (if you hover over points).</p>
    <p><img src="viewerhistory_small.gif" alt="Chatty Channel Info Dialog" /></p>
    
    <h2>Get notified about streams you follow that go live (and join them)</h2>
    <p>Open the <code>Live Channels</code>-window via <code>Channels - Live Channels</code>
    to open up a list of streams you follow that are currently live or streams
    whose channel you have currently joined that are currently live.</p>
    
    <p>(You need to have the <a href="help.html#login">required access</a> with your login data to see streams
    you follow.)</p>
    
    <p>You can enable/disable showing streams you follow in the <code>Settings - Notifications</code>.
    There you can also configure what kind of Tray Notification you want to have
    pop up for stream status changes or highlighted messages.</p>
    
    <p>To join channels directly out of the <code>Live Channels</code>-dialog
        right-click on a stream to open the context menu and then select <code>Join channel</code>
    to join the channel for that stream and if you want also open the stream in
    your browser or <a href="help-livestreamer.html">Streamlink</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>More stuff you might want to try out..</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right-clicking</strong>, or whatever opens a context menu
        in your OS. There are a lot of context menus in Chatty, e.g. for usernames
        (as shown above), links, emoticons, anywhere else in the channel, tabs,
        entries in favorites, the live streams dialog, the Channel Info dialog..</li>
        <li><strong>Configure Chatty</strong> to your needs. Open the <code>Settings</code>
            from the <code>Main</code>-menu to get all kinds of settings to adjust
            Chatty to your preference. Please make use of the <code>Help</code> link
            in the bottom left corner of the <code>Settings</code>-dialog to get
            help on the current page of settings you have selected.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask</strong> if you don't understand something. I tried to
        make the help as comprehensive and easy to understand as possible, but
        a lot of stuff is probably pretty confusing if you aren't as familiar with
        the program as I am. So please ask about stuff and maybe also (if you can)
        propose changes to the help that would make it easier to understand. There
        are various ways to <a href="help.html#contact">contact</a> me.</li>
    </ul>
