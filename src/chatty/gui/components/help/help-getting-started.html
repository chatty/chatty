    <h1><a name="top">Getting Started</a></h1>
    <p>This is a short guide to help you with installing Chatty and getting familiar with some of it's features.</p>
    
    <h2>Download & Installation</h2>
    <p>You can download Chatty from it's <a href="http://chatty.github.io/#download">Website</a>.
        The download simply consists of a <code>.zip</code>-file which you should
    extract wherever you want to have Chatty. The extracted files include a
    <code>Chatty.jar</code> which you should usually be able to double-click to
    start the program (if Java is installed properly). (See <a href="help-troubleshooting.html#start">the help</a>
    if Chatty won't start.)</p>
    
    <h3>Update Chatty</h3>
    <p>If you already have an older version of Chatty and want to update, then
        just replace all the files with the new ones in the <code>.zip</code>.
        Basicially just unzip the <code>.zip</code> into the same folder and overwrite
        all files if asked (unless you have some custom icons or sounds that have the same name).
        You can also unzip it into a new folder (just make sure you don't use the old version anymore).</p>
    
        <p>Your settings are saved seperately in the <a href="help-guide_folders.html">settings directory</a>
        and are not lost when you upgrade to a new version. The new version should normally
        automatically use the same settings without you needing to change anything.
        If you are interested in what your settings directory is,
        enter <code>/openDir</code> in Chatty. There is also a <code>backup</code>
        folder in there with <a href="help-guide_folders.html#backup">backups</a> of the settings.</p>
        
        <p>Please check out the <a href="help-releases.html">Release Information</a> for any changes in a new version that
        may require your attention.</p>
        
    <p><em>Note:</em> If you downgrade to an older version of Chatty, some settings (that the older
        version didn't have yet) may be lost. So make sure you don't run old versions of Chatty
        without knowing what you are doing, if you have changed settings unique to newer versions.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating a login</h2>
    <p>If you are starting Chatty for the first time, you will have to request
    login data from Twitch so Chatty can connect to chat for you and do other
    stuff like show live streams you follow.</p>
    <p>In the <code>Connect</code>-dialog, click on <code>Create login..</code>
        and then <code>Request login data</code> and simply follow the instructions.
    Once you successfully created the login, close the dialog until you get back
    to the <code>Connect</code>-dialog. (There is a <a href="help-guide2.html">Guide</a> on what to do
    when getting login data fails.)</p>
    
    <h2>Join channels (and leave channels)</h2>
    <p>In the <code>Connect</code>-dialog enter the name of the channel you want
        to join in the <code>Channel:</code> input box. The name of the channel
    is the same as the name of the stream. You can enter more than one channel
    name to join by seperating them with a comma. To connect simply press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    or click on <code>Connect</code>. After connecting, it will automatically join
    the channels you specified.</p>
    
    <p>Even after connecting you can join additional channels via <code>Channels - Join Channel</code>
        or entering the command <code>/join &lt;channelname&gt;</code> in the inputbox
        (e.g. <code>/join joshimuz</code>).</p>
    
    <p>You can leave channels by right-clicking anywhere in the channel and
        selecting <code>Close Channel</code> from the context menu or right-clicking
    on the channel's tab (only available if there is more than one channel) and
    selecting <code>Close</code> from the context menu.</p>
    
    <h2>Chatting and Moderating</h2>
    <p>Chatting is pretty straightfoward as you would expect from any chat program,
    however the inputbox has a few useful features. Enter the beginning of a name
    in chat and press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to <a href="help.html#nickCompletion">auto-complete</a> the name.
    Press <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> key to go back to <a href="help.html#inputHistory">previous stuff you entered</a>.</p>
    
    <p>To moderate a chat, you can of course use the regular moderations commands
        like <code>/ban</code>, <code>/timeout</code> and so on, but a much more
    convenient method is to click on the name of a user you want to ban/timeout,
    which opens the <code>User</code>-dialog, containing several moderation
    buttons as well as the recent messages of that user, so you can quickly check
    if you are actually timing out the correct user.</p>
    
    <p>Also check out the options to <a href="help.html#pausechat">pause chat</a>
        and timing out users via <a href="help.html#userselection">shortcuts only</a>.</p>
    
    <p><img src="userdialog.jpg" alt="User Dialog with moderation buttons" /></p>
    
    <h2>Information about the current stream</h2>
    <p>Chatty regulary requests information about the current stream, which is
        displayed in the titlebar and the <code>Channel Info</code>-dialog.</p>
    
    <p><img src="0_4_overview_top.png" alt="Chatty Title and Tabs" /></p>
    
    <p>You can open the <code><a href="help.html#channelinfo">Channel Info</a></code> via the <code>View</code>-menu
    or the channel context menu (right-click anywhere on the channel). The
    <code>Channel Info</code> contains the current title/game but also a history
    of the Viewercount and previous title/games (if you hover over points).</p>
    <p><img src="viewerhistory_small.gif" alt="Chatty Channel Info Dialog" /></p>
    
    <h2>Get notified about streams you follow that go live (and join them)</h2>
    <p>Open the <code>Live Channels</code>-window via <code>Channels - Live Channels</code>
    to open up a list of streams you follow that are currently live or streams
    whose channel you have currently joined that are currently live.</p>
    
    <p>(You need to have the <a href="help.html#login">required access</a> with your login data to see streams
    you follow.)</p>
    
    <p>You can enable/disable showing streams you follow in the <code>Settings - Notifications</code>.
    There you can also configure what kind of Tray Notification you want to have
    pop up for stream status changes or highlighted messages.</p>
    
    <p>To join channels directly out of the <code>Live Channels</code>-dialog
        right-click on a stream to open the context menu and then select <code>Join channel</code>
    to join the channel for that stream and if you want also open the stream in
    your browser or <a href="help-livestreamer.html">Livestreamer</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>More stuff you might want to try out..</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right-clicking</strong>, or whatever opens a context menu
        in your OS. There are a lot of context menus in Chatty, e.g. for usernames
        (as shown above), links, emoticons, anywhere else in the channel, tabs,
        entries in favorites, the live streams dialog, the Channel Info dialog..</li>
        <li><strong>Configure Chatty</strong> to your needs. Open the <code>Settings</code>
            from the <code>Main</code>-menu to get all kinds of settings to adjust
            Chatty to your preference. Please make use of the <code>Help</code> link
            in the bottom left corner of the <code>Settings</code>-dialog to get
            help on the current page of settings you have selected.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask</strong> if you don't understand something. I tried to
        make the help as comprehensive and easy to understand as possible, but
        a lot of stuff is probably pretty confusing if you aren't as familiar with
        the program as I am. So please ask about stuff and maybe also (if you can)
        propose changes to the help that would make it easier to understand. There
        are various ways to <a href="help.html#contact">contact</a> me.</li>
    </ul>
