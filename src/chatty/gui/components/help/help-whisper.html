    <p><em>It is recommended that you read and understand this whole section
        before enabling this feature.</em></p>
    
    <p>Chatty implements the new <code>/w</code> command that Twitch Chat
        provides, allowing you to send private messages in chat to other users.
        However, it is disabled by default, since it has a few problems:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Twitch is planning to move Whispering to a whole different system
            soon, which means in the current state it is not really encouraged
            to be used by third-party applications. It is unclear what the new
            system will be and whether it will be possible to implement it in
            Chatty. Also, due to these circumstances, not too much development
            time will be put into the Whisper feature in Chatty at this time.</li>
        <li>Whispering currently runs on the Group Chat servers, so Chatty can't
            just use <code>irc.twitch.tv</code> to connect as for regular chat.
            Since there is no easy official way to get the server data
            automatically, you have enter the IP and port yourself if you want
            to use this feature.</li>
    </ul>
        
        
    <h2><a name="start">Getting started</a></h2>
    <p>You have to change a few settings in order to use this feature
        (all under <code>Main - Settings - Advanced</code>):</p>
    
    <h3>Required settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Whisper Enabled</strong>: Connect to the given Group Chat
            server to send and receive whispers. Enable when you configured the
            server. Disable this it if you run into problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Server/Port</strong>: You can click on
            <code>Select server..</code> and select a server from the list (all
            listed <em>should</em> work). This is using an unsupported Twitch
            API which is not guaranteed to stay the same.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Once these settings are correctly configured, Chatty will connect to
        Whispers when you connect to regular chat. It will disconnect when you
        disconnect from regular chat via the Main-menu. If the Whisper Feature
        is properly connected and ready to use, <code>[W]</code> will be shown
        in the titlebar and the <code>/connection</code> command will show the
        Whisper connection in addition to the regular chat connection.</p>
    
    <p>If you were already connected when you changed these settings, either
        disconnect and connect again (via the Main menu) or restart Chatty.</p>

    <p>If <code>Select server..</code> is not working, configure the server manually:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server</strong>: The Group Chat server IP to connect to. You can check:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://twitchstatus.com/">Twitchstatus.com</a> (unofficial site) at the bottom of the page,
                    "Group Chat" tab, "irc" Protocol (not "ws_irc")</li>
                <li>Get an IP from the Twitch API using <a href="http://blog.bashtech.net/twitch-group-chat-irc/">this guide</a>
                    (you will need a token and be member of a Group Chat, you won't need to get a channelname)</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Port</strong>: The port for the Group Chat server you
            are using (you should get it along with the IP).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Optional settings</h3>
    <ul>
            <li><strong>Whitelist</strong>: If enabled, only users that have the
                <a href="help-addressbook.html">Addressbook</a> category
                <code>whisper</code> will be able to send whispers to you.
                Messages from other users are discarded. Alternatively you can
                also <strong>blacklist</strong> users by adding them to the
                <code>blockwhisper</code> category (which makes most sense with
                the Whitelist setting disabled).<br /><br >
                
                In addition, you can also add users to the Ignore List by
                right-clicking on them in chat to open the context menu and
                choosing <code>Miscellaneous - Ignore (whisper)</code>. Unlike
                the Blacklist or Whitelist using the Addressbook, this will not
                completely discard the messages, but instead add them to the
                Ignored Messages dialog and possibly output some other messages
                about it, depending on the Ignore settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Display</strong>: Changes where the whispers are
                displayed.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Active Chat</strong> - Show in the chat window
                        you are currently having active in Chatty.</li>
                    <li><strong>One Window</strong> - Show all whispers in one
                        separate window. In that window you will be able to
                        respond to whispers by just typing <code>&lt;name&gt;
                        &lt;message&gt;</code> instead of having to use the
                        <code>/w</code> command. To be sure you actually provide
                        the user to send it to you can only whisper to users
                        that have already whispered to you (so e.g.
                        <code>Hey how are you? :)</code> wont't be send to the
                        user named <code>Hey</code>). The tab for collecting all
                        whispers is named <code>$[whisper]</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Per User</strong> - Open an extra tab for every
                        user that whispers to you. You can respond to whispers
                        by just typing the message in the tab for that user. The
                        tab will be named <code>$&lt;username&gt;</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    <p>When the Whisper Feature is connected (<code>[W]</code> appears in the
        titlebar) you can receive and send whispers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you receive a whisper, it will be displayed depending on the
            Display setting and will be indicated by the nickname being marked
            like this: <code>-[name]-</code></li>
        <li>When you send a whisper via
            <code>/w &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt;</code>, then this will be
            indicated in chat by the nickname being marked like this:
            <code>&gt;&gt;[name]</code></li>
        <li>In both cases the name is the name of the person you are talking
            with, not your own name.</li>
        <li>When you click on the name, you will be able to see your
            conversation, with your own messages marked with a asterisk in front
            (*), which is usually used to mark action messages
            (<code>/me</code>).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
    <p>If you get a lot of errors like <code>Whisper feature: Disconnected</code> this
        may be due to different reasons:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A temporary problem with Twitch or your internet connection, in which
            case just wait a while.</li>
        <li>Wrong server/port entered, follow the <a href="#start">Getting Started</a>
            guide to check if the data you entered is still correct.</li>
        <li>Twitch changed the system and it is not working as implemented in Chatty
            anymore (in which case you should disable the feature).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>How to proceed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check <a href="http://twitchstatus.com">Twitchstatus.com</a> (mainly Group Chat Tab),
            <a href="https://twitter.com/chattyclient">@ChattyClient</a> and
            other usual places to find out if the problem lies with Twitch.
            Disable the Whisper Feature if necessary.</li>
        <li>If the <code>[W]</code> in the titlebar isn't there, but it also
            doesn't output errors anymore, it may have given up trying to connect,
            in which case you should connect to regular chat through the <code>Main</code>
            menu (disconnect first if necessary). Connecting to whispers is
            currently somewhat tied to connecting to regular chat. Disconnecting
            from regular chat from the <code>Main</code> menu will also disconnect
            from whispers.</li>
    </ul>
