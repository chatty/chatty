    <p>Chatty implements the <code>/w</code> command that Twitch Chat
        provides, allowing you to send private messages in chat to other users.
        Chatty does not provide the Whisper History as on the website and is
        only a very basic implementation in general.</p>
    
    <p>The Whisper Feature is disabled by default.</p>
    
    <p>In April 2016 Twitch moved Whispers from the Group Chat servers to the
        new AWS Twitch Chat servers. There is no additional server configuration
        required anymore.</p>
        
        
    <h2><a name="start">Settings</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Whisper Enabled</strong>: Allow sending and receiving
            Whispers. With this disabled, you won't be able to send Whispers and
            any received Whispers will be entirely ignored.</li>
            <li><strong>Whitelist</strong>: If enabled, only users that have the
                <a href="help-addressbook.html">Addressbook</a> category
                <code>whisper</code> will be able to send whispers to you.
                Messages from other users are discarded. Alternatively you can
                also <strong>blacklist</strong> users by adding them to the
                <code>blockwhisper</code> category (which makes most sense with
                the Whitelist setting disabled).<br /><br >
                
                In addition, you can also add users to the Ignore List by
                right-clicking on them in chat to open the context menu and
                choosing <code>Miscellaneous - Ignore (whisper)</code>. Unlike
                the Blacklist or Whitelist using the Addressbook, this will not
                completely discard the messages, but instead add them to the
                Ignored Messages dialog and possibly output some other messages
                about it, depending on the Ignore settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Display</strong>: Changes where the whispers are
                displayed.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Active Chat</strong> - Show in the chat window
                        you are currently having active in Chatty.</li>
                    <li><strong>One Window</strong> - Show all whispers in one
                        separate window. In that window you will be able to
                        respond to whispers by just typing <code>&lt;name&gt;
                        &lt;message&gt;</code> instead of having to use the
                        <code>/w</code> command. To be sure you actually provide
                        the user to send it to you can only whisper to users
                        that have already whispered to you (so e.g.
                        <code>Hey how are you? :)</code> wont't be send to the
                        user named <code>Hey</code>). The tab for collecting all
                        whispers is named <code>$[whisper]</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Per User</strong> - Open an extra tab for every
                        user that whispers to you. You can respond to whispers
                        by just typing the message in the tab for that user. The
                        tab will be named <code>$&lt;username&gt;</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Auto-respond to ignored/non-whitelisted users</strong>:
                If enabled, sends an automatic reponse to users that you have
                ignored (or not whitelisted if you have the whitelist enabled),
                if they whisper to you. This does not apply to messages that are
                ignored due to the regular ignore list, just the separate user
                ignore list (changeable through the Settings, commands or the
                User Context Menu) or the special Addressbook categories for
                whispers (see above).<br />
                The message being sent is <code>[Auto-Message] This user has not
                allowed to receive whispers from you.</code>. The message is
                only sent once per session to each different user that whispers
                to you and is also spam protected.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    <p>When the Whisper Feature is connected (<code>[W]</code> appears in the
        titlebar) you can receive and send whispers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you receive a whisper, it will be displayed depending on the
            Display setting and will be indicated by the nickname being marked
            like this: <code>-[name]-</code></li>
        <li>When you send a whisper via
            <code>/w &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt;</code>, then this will be
            indicated in chat by the nickname being marked like this:
            <code>&gt;&gt;[name]</code></li>
        <li>In both cases the name is the name of the person you are talking
            with, not your own name.</li>
        <li>When you click on the name, you will be able to see your
            conversation, with your own messages marked with a asterisk in front
            (*), which is usually used to mark action messages
            (<code>/me</code>).</li>
    </ul>
