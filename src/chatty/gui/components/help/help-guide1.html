    <h1><a name="top">Guide: Run more than one instance of Chatty</a></h1>
    <p>If you want to run Chatty more than once at the same time, you may need
    to know how it saves it's settings. By default the settings are saved
    in your user-directory in the subfolder <code>.chatty</code> (where it is
    exactly is system-dependant, enter <code>/dir</code> in Chatty to show it's location). When you run the program, it loads the settings
    and when you exit the program, it saves them, overwriting the file with
    no regard to possible changes (to the file) that may have occured in the meantime.</p>
    <p>This means that when you run more than one instance on the same computer,
    the last one you close always overwrites the settings.</p>
    
    <h2>Separate settings</h2>
    <p>You can change the default settings directory by using the <code>-cd</code>
    commandline paramter, which changes the settings directory to the current
    working directory, meaning the settings are loaded and saved in the same
    location you specified as working directory.</p>
    
    <p>This means you can easily run more than one instance on the same computer
    with completely different settings, just by using that commandline parameter
    and specifying different working directories (e.g. in Windows in the shortcut
    settings).</p>
    
    <p>You can also use the <code>-d &lt;dir&gt;</code> parameter to specify the
        directory directly. For example if you create two different shortcuts
        like this:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><code>javaw -jar "D:\Chatty\Chatty.jar" -d "D:\Chatty\settings1"</code></li>
        <li><code>javaw -jar "D:\Chatty\Chatty.jar" -d "D:\Chatty\settings2"</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Of course you have to change <code>D:\Chatty\Chatty.jar</code> to where 
        your <code>Chatty.jar</code> is actually located. You also need to first
        create the settings folders you specify.</p>
    
    <p>If you're using the Windows Standalone, then simply run <code>Chatty.exe</code>
        instead:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><code>"D:\Chatty\Chatty.exe" -d "D:\Chatty\settings1"</code></li>
        <li><code>"D:\Chatty\Chatty.exe" -d "D:\Chatty\settings2"</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Alternatively (with the Standalone), you can also add the <code>-cd</code>
        or <code>-d</code> option to the <a href="help-standalone.html#cfg-launch">Chatty.cfg</a>.
        Although since there is only one <code>Chatty.cfg</code> per installation,
        it may not be as useful if you need two separate settings directories.</p>

    <h2>Sharing login data</h2>
    <p>When you want to run several instances with different settings, but want
    to use the same account, you run into problems.
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Everytime you request login
    data (token), the old login is invalidated, so you have to share the login data
    you already have between different instances.</span>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">This may or may not be
        the case anymore.</span></p>
    
    <p>You can do this by simply copying the <code>login</code> settings file
    which contains the login data. Make sure you closed the Chatty instance
    you requested the login data with at least once, so it's actually saved
    to the file.</p>
    
    <p>You could also try to play around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symbolic links</a>
        to point to a shared <code>login</code> file.</p>
    
    <h2>Using Chatty on different computers</h2>
    <p>If you want to run Chatty on different computers with the same account,
    you run into the same problem as mentioned under <em>Sharing login data</em>:
    You can't have more than one access token with the same account for the same
    app at the same time.</p>
    <p>To use Chatty on more than one computer with the same account, you'll
        have to transfer the login data, either by copying the <code>login</code>
        file or by entering the access token manually
        (<code>/get token</code> displays the token,
        <code>/changetoken &lt;token&gt;</code> changes it).</p>
