    <p>Probably shorter guides about some aspects of Chatty.</p>
    <h2><a name="localsubonly">Local Subscriber-Only Mode</a></h2>
    <p>You can create your own local subonly mode, which ignores all messages
        written by non-subscribers.</p>
    
    <p>Features used: <a href="help-settings.html#Ignore">Ignore System</a>, <a href="help-addressbook.html">Addressbook</a>,
    <a href="help-settings.html#Commands">Custom Commands</a></p>
    
    <h3>Create Ignore Entry</h3>
    <p>Go to <code>Main - Settings - Ignore</code> and make sure <code>Enable Ignore</code>
        is ticked. Then add to the list (press the Plus-Button):</p>
    <p><code>!status:smbaf chanCat:subonly</code></p>
    <p>The <code>!status:smbaf</code> prefix matches on messages send by users that
        <em>don't</em> have any of the status levels defined, in this case users
        that are neither a subscriber (<code>s</code>), moderator (<code>m</code>), broadcaster (<code>b</code>),
        admin (<code>a</code>) or staff (<code>f</code>). So basicially this only matches on normal users.</p>
    <p>The second requirement for a match is the <code>chanCat:subonly</code>
        prefix, which refers to the channel category <code>subonly</code>, which
        means the channel the message was send in needs to have that Addressbook category.
        This is used to be able to easily toggle subonly-mode for a channel, and
        of course to prevent it being enabled in all channels you join in the
        first place.</p>
    
    <h3>Create Custom Command to modify Addressbook</h3>
    <p>To make use of the Ignore Entry defined in the previous section, you need
        to add the <code>subonly</code> category to the channel you want to have
        it enabled for. To do this, you could open the Addressbook Dialog
        (<code>Channels - Addressbook</code>) and add the channel with the
        category there (channels need a leading # in this case, so e.g. <code>#joshimuz</code>).</p>
    
    <p>You can however also use <a href="help-addressbook.html#commands">Addressbook Commands</a>:</p>
    <p><code>/ab change #joshimuz !subonly</code></p>
    <p>This toggles the <code>subonly</code> category for the given channel, so
    when the category is there, it removes the category, and when the category is not there,
    it adds the category.</p>
    <p>To do this a bit more conveniently, you can add it as a custom command. Go
        to <code>Main - Settings - Commands</code> and add the following to the
    list:</p>
    <p><code>/Toggle_Subonly /ab change #$$1 !subonly</code></p>
    <p>If you enter <code>/Toggle_Subonly joshimuz</code>, this will automatically
        run the Addressbook as mentioned above (<code>$$1</code> means this is
        being replaced with the first word after the command).</p>
    
    <p>To make this more convenient (entering the command with the correct channel
        could be a bit of a hassle), add the Custom Command to the <code>Channel Context Menu</code>
        (on the same page in the settings). Just click on <code>Edit</code> and add
    the command name (without any parameters):</p>
    <p><code>/Toggle_Subonly</code></p>
    <p>Now if you right-click on a channel, the context menu that opens should
        have an entry <code>Toggle Subonly</code>, which you can
        use to turn your own local subonly mode for the current channel on and off.</p>

    <h3>Stay informed</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the <code>&lt;View - Channel Info&gt;</code> to see your current
        stream title/game, a graph of your viewercount and how long your current
        stream already is going.</li>
        <li>Open the <code>&lt;Extra - Followers/Subscribers&gt;</code> dialog
        to view your 100 most recent Followers/Subscribers and some stats based
        on that.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Manage your stream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the <code>&lt;View - Channel Admin&gt;</code> dialog to change
        the title/game of your stream and run commercials:
        <ul>
            <li>Presets/History for title/game combinations</li>
            <li>Favorite games you play often</li>
            <li>Run commercials on a delay and/or timer</li>
            <li>Run commercials while playing a game via a global hotkey
                (Windows only)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Capture chat for on-stream chat</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Customize chat colors, for example change to black background to be
            able to make the background transparent in your streaming program.</li>
        <li>If you capture Chatty with your streaming program, make sure to
            enable the setting <code>Settings - Window - Always show chat scrollbar</code>, so you can always capture the same
            region, independant of how many messages are in the chat window.</li>
        <li>Change the font so it shows up nicely on stream.</li>
        <li>If you want to have all text in bold - not just the names - you can
            set the font by command like this: <code>/set font Arial Bold</code>.</li>
        <li>You can clear the chat window by using the <code>/clearchat</code>
            command (e.g. if you changed some settings before starting the stream
        you don't want to show).</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2><a name="eventchat">Join Eventchat</a></h2>
    <p>Sometimes there are channels that run on a special set of event chat
        servers, so they are seperated from the channels you see when you join
        <code>irc.twitch.tv</code>. This only applies to webchat (at the moment
        at least), so often the chat you get connecting to <code>irc.twitch.tv</code>
        is called "mobile chat", because the mobile apps apparently also don't
        support event chat.</p>
    
    <p>See this <a href="http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/questions/8152306-can-t-see-chat-of-some-channels-on-irc-">
            Twitch Support Center entry</a> or <a href="http://twitchstatus.com/#chat">Twitchstatus.com</a> for an (unofficial) list
    of servers.</p>
    
       <p>What you have to do in Chatty to be able to get the
        event chat instead of the "normal chat" that is only used by IRC and
        mobile users, is connect to a different server. Since Chatty can only
        connect to one server at a time, you either have to only join channels
        that are on the event chat servers, or run two <a href="help-guide1.html">seperate instances</a> of
        Chatty at the same time.</p>
       
       <p>There are different ways of connecting to a different server:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>The <code>/server &lt;host&gt;[:port]</code> command connects to the given server and
           port manually.</li>
           <li>The <code>-server</code> and <code>-port</code> commandline options
           allow you to specify a different server when you start Chatty.</li>
           <li>The <code>Server</code> and <code>Port</code> settings in the
               Settings Dialog under <code>Advanced</code> allows you to set
           fixed settings for the server to connect to. This especially makes sense
           if you are using <a href="help-guide1.html">seperate settings for different instances</a> of Chatty.</li>
       </ul>
