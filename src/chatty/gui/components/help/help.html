    </h2>
    <img src="0_4_overview_top.png" />
    <p>When in a channel, Chatty shows some information about that channel
    in the titlebar, e.g.:<br /><cite>[40|59] - GTA:SA Speedruns (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas)</cite></p>
    <p>The first number is the number of people in the chat, the second is the
    viewercount, followed by the current stream title and game. Anything other
    than the number of people in the chat is requested from the Twitch API about
    every two minutes.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, the titlebar will also show additional information, if enabled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name of the channel that is being hosted</li>
        <li><code>Sub</code> for Subscriber-Only Mode</li>
        <li><code>Slow: &lt;time&gt;</code> for Slowmode</li>
        <li><code>R9k</code> for R9Kbeta Mode</li>
        <li><code>EmoteOnly</code> for Emote-Only Mode</li>
        <li>A language code if Broadcaster Language Mode is enabled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can toggle showing some information under <code>View - Options - Titlebar</code>.</p>
    
    <p>Note that the stream status (title/game, offline) can take a few minutes
        to update, since it has to be requested from the Twitch API (which is
        also heavily cached).</p>

    </h2>
    <p>All command names are case-insensitive. Something like <code>&lt;parameter&gt;</code>
        represents a required parameter which must be entered for the command to
        work properly (you don't enter the surrounding <code>&lt; &gt;</code>,
        they are just there to show it's a parameter). Equivalently <code>[parameter]</code>
    represents an optional parameter.</p>
    
    <p>You can also create your own <a href="help-custom_commands.html">Custom Commands &amp; Customized Context Menus</a>.</p>
    
    <p><em>Tip:</em> You can also use TAB Completion for many commands.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="commands-chat">Chat commands:</a></h3>

    </h2>
    <p>The login data consists of a <em>username</em> (or account name) and most
        importantly an <em>access token</em>, which is sort of a revokable
        password that can also have different types of access associated with
        it, the ones usable for Chatty being:</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt><code>Chat access</code></dt>
        <dd>Required to connect to chat (required for Chatty).</dd>
        
        <dt><code>Read user info</code></dt>
        <dd>Required to request the streams you follow, so you can get <a href="#notifications">notified</a>
            when they start streaming.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>Editor access</code></dt>
        <dd>Allows you to change the title/game of your stream and streams you
            are an editor in via the <a href="help-admin.html">Admin Dialog</a>.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>Run commercials</code></dt>
        <dd>Allows you to run comercials on your stream 
        via the <a href="help-admin.html">Admin Dialog</a> (if you are partnered).</dd>
        
        <dt><code>Show subscribers</code></dt>
        <dd>Required to view the list of your subscribers 
            via the <a href="#followers">Subscribers Dialog</a> (if you have a sub button).</dd>
        
        <dt><code>Follow channels</code>
        <dd>Gives you access to use the context menu (right-click) entries
            <code>Miscellaneous - Follow/Unfollow Channel</code> and use the
            <code>/follow</code> and <code>/unfollow</code> commands.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Once requested from Twitch, the login data is stored locally on your
        computer along with the other settings of Chatty.
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Since Twitch gives out the
        access token per application, any access token for the same account
        requested with Chatty will be invalidated when you request a new access
        token</span>.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">This doesn't seem to be the
            case anymore.</span></p>
    
    <p>If getting login data fails, read <a href="help-guide2.html">this guide</a>.
        If your login was determined invalid, read <a href="#login-invalid">down below</a>.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="access">Allow more access</a></h3>
    <p>To allow Chatty more access than it already has (e.g. if you haven't
        selected editor access before, but you want it now), you need to request
        a new access token. Just go to <code>&lt;Main - Login..&gt;</code>,
        delete the login and request it again with the necessary access.</p>
    
    <h3>Allow less access</h3>
    <p>To allow Chatty less access than it already has (e.g. you don't want it
        to have editor access anymore) you need to first revoke access
        completely in your Twitch Account
        <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections">Settings</a>, then
        authorize access again. What will not work is just requesting a new
        token without selecting the now unwanted access. Twitch will always
        respond with a token that has at least as much access as the previous
        one.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="login-security">Security</a></h3>
    <p>The access token is saved in the <code>login</code> file in the settings
        <a href="help-guide_folders.html">directory</a> and can thus be accessed
        by anyone having access to your computer.
    It allows anyone who obtains it to chat in your name and access the other
    things listed above (if you allowed it when getting the token). If you think
    the token may have been compromised, please immediately go to your Twitch
    Settings subsection
    <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections">Connections</a>
    and <em>revoke the accesss</em> there. You can then request a new one for
    which Twitch will ask you to authorize Chatty again.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="login-invalid">Invalid Login</a></h3>
    <p>If your login is determined invalid (either by checking it manually or
    when Chatty performed an automatic check), this can mean one of two things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your login is actually still valid, Twitch is just derping:
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes the Twitch API won't recognize any login as valid,
                    for a while. This is likely the reason if other users have
                    the same issue at the same time.</li>
                <li>How to proceed:
                <ul>
                    <li>In this case, requesting new login data from Twitch probably
                        won't help at all. Go to <code>&lt;Main - Login..&gt;</code>
                        to open the <code>Login configuration</code> and click on <code>[Verify login]</code> a few times
                        (with a few minutes in between attempts).</li>
                    <li>If you are already connected to chat, you can just stay
                        connected. Just try <code>[Verify login]</code> a bit later to
                        be able to use the features that require Twitch
                        authorization again.</li>
                    <li>If <code>[Verify login]</code> keeps returning invalid,
                        even after a while (especially without other users
                        having the same issue), your login may actually be
                        invalid.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your login is actually invalid:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through">You have requested new login data for the same Twitch Account from
                    another instance of Chatty, for example on another Computer, which
                    has automatically invalidated the previously requested login data
                    (access token).</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline">This may or may not
                        be the case anymore.</span></li>
                <li>You have just requested login data and something went wrong, or it
                    wasn't loaded properly from the settings.</li>
                <li>The token was invalidated for some other reason.</li>
                <li>How to proceed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Go to <code>&lt;Main - Login..&gt;</code> to open
                            the <code>Login configuration</code> (you may
                            already have it open), click <code>[Remove login]</code>
                            and create a new login.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>What happens when your login is no longer valid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can't connect to chat anymore. If you are already connected and
        stay connected, this doesn't matter.</li>
        <li>Your followed streams are no longer requested, so you may not be
        informed about streams starting anymore (if you had that enabled in the
        first place).</li>
        <li>Other features that require authentication won't work properly anymore, like
        the Admin Dialog.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="http://frankerfacez.com">FrankerFaceZ</a> provides a custom

    <h2>
        <a name="userlist">Userlist</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The userlist on the side of the channel shows all users currently
        considered to be in the channel.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A user gets added to the userlist..
            <ul>
                <li>..when the user says something in chat.</li>
                <li>..when Chatty receives a JOIN from Twitch Chat for that user (or
                    that user is on the received NAMES list).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A user gets removed from the userlist..
            <ul>
                <li>..when Chatty receives a PART from Twitch Chat for that user.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The userlist gets cleared entirely..
            <ul>
                <li>..when you close the channel (close the Tab).</li>
                <li>..when you rejoin the channel (e.g. when reconnecting).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In order to receive JOIN/PART messages, the setting <code>Correct Userlist</code>
        under <code>Settings - Advanced - Connection</code> has to be enabled.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> The userlist is not very reliable and should only be taken
        as a rough estimate of who is currently in the channel. This is because:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>JOIN/PART messages are sent in batches and can be pretty delayed, so
        so it may happen that a user who only just started showing up in the
        userlist joined half a minute ago (or even already left again).</li>
        <li>It can take some time for Twitch to send the userlist when you join
        a channel. In big channels it may not be sent at all.</li>
        <li>MOD/UNMOD messages are unreliable as well, so mod status in the
        userlist may not always be correct. Twitch Chat has also been known to
        sometimes spam MOD/UNMOD messages.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Also note that the userlist doesn't necessarily have to do with who
        watches your stream. A user can be logged into chat without watching the
        stream and vice versa. Overall, just don't take the userlist too
        seriously.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="TAB_Completion">TAB Completion</a><a name="nickCompletion"></a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>When typing in the inputbox, you can use the following keys by default
        (this can be changed in the <a href="help-settings.html#Completion">Completion settings</a>):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>TAB</kbd> to complete usernames</li>
        <li><kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to complete Emoticons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a completion is initiated, <kbd>TAB</kbd> and <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd>
        cycle forwards and backward through the results.</p>

    <p>Some prefixes always force a certain completion type
        no matter if you use <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd>:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Prefixing <code>@</code> completes usernames</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>/</code> completes command names</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>:</code> completes Emoji codes (not Twitch Emotes!)</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>.</code> performs <a href="help-settings.html#TAB_Completion-custom">Custom completion</a></li>
        <li>Certain commands such as <code>/ban</code> complete usernames for
            their first parameter</li>
        <li>Setting commands such as <code>/set</code> complete setting names
            for their first parameter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>How the TAB Completion process works:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Enter the beginning of an item (name, setting, emote).</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> (see above)
            to enter the completion mode, which will:
            <ul>
                <li>Complete to the full item (e.g. full name) if there is only
                one item matching what you entered</li>
                <li>For more than one match, depending on the <em>Complete to common prefix</em> setting:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complete to the common prefix of all found items that match
                        what you entered, allowing you to enter more characters
                        to refine the search and then press <kbd>TAB</kbd> or
                        <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> again to enter a new completion</li>
                        <li>Complete to the full item of the first match</li>
                        <li>If enabled, it will also show a popup with information
                        about the completion, which doesn't show if there is only
                        one match</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You can then either:
            <ul>
                <li>Press <kbd>TAB</kbd> repeatedly to cycle forwards through the found
                    matches or <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to cycle backwards</li>
                <li>Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to cancel the completion mode and go
                    back to the text when you started the completion</li>
                <li>Continue typing/editing the text to exit the completion
                    while keeping what you already completed</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The found matches are all ordered alphabetically, except for nickcompletion
    for which you can choose different types of sorting. By default nicknames use
    predictive sorting, which means users who recently wrote a message or highlighted
    you have a higher priority, increasing the chance that the users you want to
    address appear as the first few matches.</p>
    
    <h3>Example: Nick Completion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter <code>z</code> in the editbox</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to complete as a nickname (assuming the <a href="help-settings.html#Completion">setting</a> is that)
            <ul>
                <li>On default settings, this may complete to <code>ze_tt</code>
                with two other results</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cycle through to <code>zMASKm</code> by:
            <ul>
                <li>Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd>, which cycles fowards to <code>zMASKm</code></li>
                <li>Or press <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to cycle backwards to <code>zeblover</code>
                    and <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> again to cycle to <code>zMASKm</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Example: Emote Completion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter <code>dat</code> in the editbox</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to complete as an emote (assuming the <a href="help-settings.html#Completion">setting</a> is that)
            <ul>
                <li>On default settings, this may complete to <code>DatHass</code> with two other results</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cycle through to <code>DatSheffy</code> by:
            <ul>
                <li>Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd>, which cycles fowards to <code>DatSaunce</code>
                    and <kbd>TAB</kbd> again to cycle to <code>DatSheffy</code></li>
                <li>Or press <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to cycle backwards
                    to <code>DatSheffy</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </h2>
    <p>Chatty provdes an input history for the chat input box that allows you to
    call up lines you entered previously, to make it easier to e.g. repeat
    commands with similiar parameters, repeat messages you send to chat or just
    look up what you wrote before. You can even save messages to the history
    that you haven't send yet to be able to send them later.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How lines are saved in the history:
            <ul>
                <li>Send a message or enter a command</li>
                <li>Press <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> after entering/editing a message
                (which saves it to the history, but also clears the input box)</li>
                <li>Identical lines already in the history are removed (or you

                <li>Pressing <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> when you already entered some

                <li>Pressing <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> when you already entered some
                text clears the input box and but also saves what you entered to
                the history (as mentioned above).</li>
                <li>When you navigated to a history item and edited it:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pressing <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> will move to the previous

    them to increase contrast. This doesn't work very well though, although it
    should work for extreme cases like white on white or black on black.</p>
    
    <h3>Custom Colors</h3>
    <p>You can also specify custom colors for certain users or types of users
    in the settings. Custom colors are indicated by two asterisks (**) in the
    User Info Dialog.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Chatty supports the following types of emoticons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Twitch Emoticons (Global, Turbo, Subscriber)</li>
        <li><a href="http://frankerfacez.com/">FrankerFaceZ</a> Emoticons
            <ul>
                <li>Global and Channel-specific Emotes</li>
                <li>Feature Friday Emotes</li>
                <li>Featured Emotes (usually available in Speedrunning Marathons)
                    <br /><em>Note:</em> These emotes require being connected to
                    the FFZ Socket Server to be updated. There is an issue where
                    reconnecting to the server sometimes doesn't work. If you
                    enter the command <code>/ffzws</code> and it is stuck at
                    <code>Connecting..</code> for a longer period of time, you
                    may have to restart Chatty for it to work again.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.nightdev.com/betterttv/">BetterTTV</a> Emoticons
            <ul>
                <li>Global and Channel-specific Emotes
                    <br /><em>Note:</em> BTTV can also contain GIF emotes, some
                    of which don't work very well in Chatty. (You also have to
                    opt-in to show them in the settings in the first place.)</li>
                <li><strong>Not supported</strong> are Personal Emotes</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Emoji, turns the Unicode Emoji character into an image (you can
            enter Emoji either by pasting the character directly, or by entering
            a shortcode (e.g. <code>:thinking:</code>) into the inputbox, which
            will be turned into the character when you press Enter to send it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Tip:</em> You can use <a href="#TAB_Completion">TAB Completion</a>
        for Emoticon codes (Shift-TAB by default) and Emoji shortcodes.</p>
    
    <p>You can enable/disable Emoticons in general (displaying the images instead
        of the text) in the settings under <code>Emoticons</code>. You can also
        ignore specific emotes in the same place in the settings.</p>
    
    <p>In chat you can right-click on an emoticon to show some info about it.
        Click on the emote code (e.g. <code>FrankerZ</code>) in the context menu
        to insert the emote in the inputbox. If it is a subscriber emote, you
        also have some more options.</p>
    
    <h3>Emote Dialog</h3>
    <p>Use <code>Extra - Emoticons</code> or press <kbd>Ctrl-E</kbd> to open
        the Emote Dialog, which has various pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>Favorites</code> page lists emotes you have added to the favorites
        via the Emote Context Menu (right-click on an emote in the dialog or chat and
        choose <code>Favorite</code>, emotes that already are favorited can be
        removed from favorites the same way).</li>
        <li>The <code>My Emotes</code> page lists the emotes you paid for (Subemotes/Turbo).</li>
        <li>The <code>Channel</code> page lists the emotes that are specific to the current channel
        (FFZ and BTTV, if there are any). It also includes
    the subscriber emotes of the current channel (if it has any), whether you
    can use them or not (but it displays a message if you are not subscribed).</li>
        <li>The <code>Twitch</code> page shows all free global Twitch emotes</li>
        <li>The <code>Other</code> page shows all global FZZ/BTTV emotes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Click on an emote to insert it into the current channel inputbox. Double-click
        on an emote to also close the Emote Dialog in the process, or press <kbd>ESC</kbd> or
    <kbd>Ctrl-E</kbd> to close it. Right-click on an emote to show a context menu
    with some more information/options.</p>
    
    <p>Right-click on an emote and choose <code>Show Details</code> to open the
    Detail View in the Emote Dialog, which shows the emote in different sizes
    and some information about it. Clicking on an emote in chat also opens the
    Detail View.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note that you need to have joined at least one channel for your subemotes/turbo emotes
        to show up, because only then does Twitch Chat send that information to the client.</em></p>

            <a name="customemotes">Custom Emotes (local)</a>
            <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
        </h2>
        <p>You can add your own local emotes by creating a file called <code>emotes.txt</code>
            in the settings directory (enter <code>/dir</code> in Chatty to find the
            settings directory, <code>/openDir</code> to directly open it). The
        file can have one emote on each line, for example:</p>

        <p>This can be used to replace existing emotes, since custom emotes are
        checked first and thus take precedence. This is not intended to replace
        FFZ or BTTV emotes, just to help configure emotes to your personal
        preference. For example you could also add an image for you own name to
        have it highlighted in chat in a different way.</p>
        
        <p><em>Note:</em> The <code>emotes.txt</code> should be saved in the
            UTF-8 encoding (or ASCII I guess).</p>
        
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        
        <p>The syntax per line is (you can use as many spaces or TABs as seperators as you want):</p>
        
        <p><code>[settings] &lt;code&gt; [settings] &lt;image&gt; [settings]</code></p>
        
        <p>Settings can be in any of the shown places, but are always optional. Available settings are:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><code>set:&lt;setid&gt;</code> to specify a
        Twitch emote set. This will only affect messages you write yourself.</li>
            <li><code>id:&lt;emoteid&gt;</code> to specify a Twitch emote id to
            replace. This will only affect incoming messages.</li>
            <li><code>chan:&lt;channel&gt;</code> to restrict the emote to the
            given channel.</li>
            <li><code>size:&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</code> to specify the
            size of the emote (you can omit this if you want to use the image
            size).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>code</strong> can be prefixed with <code>re:</code>
            to specify a regular expression. Otherwise it is interpreted as plain text
            (the same as regular Twitch emotes, case-sensitive and usually separated
            by space from other characters).</li>
            <li>The <strong>image file</strong> is relative to the settings directory (where you created
            the <code>emotes.txt</code> in), so just put them in the same directory.
        You should also be able to use URLs to load the image from the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Lines starting with <code>#</code> are ignored and can be used for comments.</p>
        
        <p>The <code>emotes.txt</code> file is loaded when you start Chatty, so if you edit the file
            while Chatty is running, you have to use the <code>/reloadCustomEmotes</code>
            command for it to take effect.
        Emote images may be cached, so if you change the image, you MAY have to
        clear the cache (<code>/clearemotecache CUSTOM</code>).</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="userselection">User/Line Selection Mode</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>With this feature, you can select a user in chat with keyboard shortcuts
    (if the window is active). So you can e.g. timeout a user with your keyboard
    alone.</p>
    
    <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl-Space</kbd> (can be changed in the settings) to enter
        this mode. If there are any user
    messages in chat, then the newest message will get another background color
    which shows that it is selected. In that mode, the focus is on the textpane,
    which enables more shortcuts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>W</kbd> to move up a user</li>
        <li><kbd>S</kbd> to move down a user</li>
        <li><kbd>A</kbd> to move up twice</li>
        <li><kbd>D</kbd> to move down twice</li>
        <li><kbd>Q</kbd> to quit out of the mode</li>
        <li><kbd>E</kbd> to open the User Dialog for the currently selected user</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When you move up and down, it actually switches to the next user instead
    of to the next line. So if the same user send 10 messages in a row, it will
    jump to the first message of the next user above it.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to the currently selected message, it will also highlight all
        other messages by the same user. You can also hold <kbd>AltGr</kbd> and
    click on a username in chat to highlight all that users messages (and enter
    User Selection Mode).</p>
    
    <p>You can also click and hold in an empty area of the textpane, which puts
    and holds the focus there, so you can just use the shortcuts in the list
    above to enter the User Selection Mode and switch between messages. However
    if you let go of the mouse key, it will immediately leave the mode again.</p>
    
    <h3>Using Global Hotkeys</h3>
    <p>You can also configure global hotkeys with some User Selection actions.
    However, if the focus is not on the chat, then the usual shortcuts won't
    work, so you'll have to define additional global hotkeys to e.g. timeout the
    currently selected user. See the hotkey settings for what actions are
    available.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="streamchat">Stream Chat</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
        <p>Stream Chat is a seperate dialog, opened via the <code>/openStreamChat</code>
            command or the <code>Extra</code> menu, that can have chat messages from one or several
    channels redirected to it (only regular chat messages, so no JOINS/PARTS, info messages
    and so on). It also can have a message timeout set, so messages will
    disappear after a certain amount of seconds.</p>
        
        <p>The idea is to capture Stream Chat to display chat on stream and
        messages will only be displayed if the chat has been recently active. So
        this doesn't really make a lot of sense for busier channels, unless you
        simply prefer to only have regular messages or to have a seperate dialog
        for the capture.</p>
        
        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>You need to add the channel which messages are redirected to the
        Stream Chat dialog before anything will appear. The setting you are required
        to change is <code>streamChatChannels</code>,
        which is a list setting giving you different ways of editing it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>/set streamChatChannels #&lt;channel&gt;</code> - To set
            the channel to only this one</li>
            <li><code>/add streamChatChannels #&lt;channel&gt;</code> - To add
            a channel in addition to the ones already set</li>
            <li><code>/remove streamChatChannels #&lt;channel&gt;</code> - To remove
            a channel from the list</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Check out other <a href="help-setting_commands.html#streamchat">settings</a> that are also edited with setting commands.</p>
        <p>In addition, make sure you have <code>Settings - Window - Restore dialogs</code>
            set to at least <code>Restore dialogs from last session</code> in order
            to keep the position/size of the Stream Chat dialog between sessions.</p>
        
        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>/openStreamChat</code> - Opens the Stream Chat dialog</li>
            <li><code>/setStreamChatSize &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</code> - Set the exact size of the Stream Chat dialog in pixels</li>
            <li><code>/getStreamChatSize</code> - Shows the size of the Stream Chat dialog in pixels</li>
            <li><code>/clearStreamChat</code> - Removes all messages</li>
            <li><code>/streamChatTest [message]</code> - Adds a test message to the Stream Chat dialog, if you don't specify a message
            a default one is used</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="customNames">Custom Names</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You can give people in chat custom names that will appear in chat and
    in the userlist instead of the regular Twitch username and in the User Info
    Dialog in addition to the regular Twitch username. In other places (like
    the User Context Menu) the regular Twitch username is used.</p>
    
    <p>TAB Completion also allows you to complete Custom Names and by default
        also includes the original name in the results.</p>
    
    <p>The following commands are used to set custom names:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/setname &lt;username&gt; &lt;custom name&gt;</code> - to set a custom name</li>
        <li><code>/resetname &lt;username&gt;</code> - to remove a custom name</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In addition to these commands, you can also view and change Custom Names
        via the Settings GUI under <code>Names</code>. You can also right-click
        on a user in chat to open the User Context Menu and choose
        <code>Miscellaneous - Set name</code> to open the Settings with the name
        preset.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="pausechat">Pause Chat / One-click moderation</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If enabled in the settings under <code>Main - Settings - Chat</code> you
        can stop the chat from scrolling down while you move the mouse over chat.
        This can prevent misclicks when the chat is moving. The chat will resume
        scrolling down as soon as you stop moving the mouse or move it out of
        the chat area. When the chat is already paused, you can also hold
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to keep the chat paused even without moving the mouse.</p>

    <p>Optionally, you can set it to require <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> being pressed in
        conjunction with moving the mouse to initiate pausing. You can let go of
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> as soon as pausing is started and it will stay paused as
        long as you move the mouse inside the chat area.</p>
    
    <p>A little popup in the top-right will indicate that the chat is paused.</p>
    
    <p><em>Please note:</em> This only works when the chat area is already filled, so the scrollbar is
        actually used. In addition, there may be instances where something you
        want to click will move anyway, for example if a message is deleted due
        to a timeout/ban, causing other messages to move.</p>
    
    <h3>Scroll up to stop scrolling</h3>
    <p>Another way of preventing scrolling down is scrolling up. Once you are
        manually scrolled up, chat will stop scrolling down automatically.
        However messages may still be removed from the buffer causing the chat
        to move despite it not actively scrolling down. It will stop removing
        messages to get moving to a minimum as long as you keep holding
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.</p>
    
    <p>A certain time after not moving the scroll position, it will scroll down
        automatically (unless <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is still being pressed).</p>
    
    <h3>One-click moderation</h3>
    <p>Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and clicking on a user in chat can execute a ban
        or timeout on that user. Enable this feature and define what it does in
        the settings (<code>Main - Settings - Chat</code>).</p>
    
    <p>It is recommended to enable the pause chat feature if you are using this,
        or else misclicks could be very common.</p>

    <p><a href="https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2662186-how-to-use-automod">AutoMod</a>
        is a Twitch feature that filters messages before they are send to the
        chat clients. As mod in the channel you can review and either approve
        or deny those filtered messages in different ways:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The AutoMod Dialog under <code>Extra - AutoMod</code></li>
        <li>Enable <code>Settings - Moderation - Show messages rejected by AutoMod</code>
            to show rejected messages directly in chat and..
            <ul>
                <li>Right-click on the username of a filtered message and
                    approve/reject from the context menu</li>
                <li>Click on the username of a filtered message to open the User

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>AutoMod Dialog</h3>
    <p>In the dialog you will see filtered messages of the current channel (if
        you are mod). Open the context menu on a message (usually right-click)
        to approve or deny that message. Double-click on a message to open the
        User Info Dialog for that user to be able to see his previous messages
        or ban/timeout the user.</p>
    
    <p>Shortcuts available when you have a message selected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>A</kbd> to approve, <kbd>D</kbd> to deny message</li>
        <li><kbd>W</kbd> to move up in the list, <kbd>Alt+W</kbd> to jump over

        <li><kbd>S</kbd> to move down in the list, <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> to jump over
            already handled messages</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Messages can have different prefixes depending on their status:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No prefix - The message has not been approved/denied yet</li>
        <li><code>Approved</code> - You have approved the message</li>
        <li><code>Denied</code> - You have denied the message</li>
        <li><code>Handled</code> - The message has been handled already,
            probably by another mod (the API does not return whether it's been
            approved or denied)</li>
        <li><code>Pending</code> - Your action is being sent to the Twitch API</li>
        <li><code>N/A</code> - The message is no longer available to be
            approved or denied (this seems to be the case after a few minutes)</li>
        <li><code>Error</code> - An error occured sending your action to the
            Twitch API</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Messages that have already been handled or that are older than 5 minutes
        (and can thus <em>probably</em> not be approved/denied anymore) are

    <h2>
        <a name="channelinfo">Channel Info / History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The Channel Info Dialog shows the current stream status of the active
    stream. The data is requested from the Twitch API in a semi-regular interval,
    so it can take some time to update.</p>
    
    <h3>Stream Uptime</h3>
    <p>If the stream is online, the <code>Live: 1h 30m</code>
    shows how long ago the stream was started. That time comes directly from the
    Twitch API, so it is able to show the correct online time, even if you started
    Chatty after the stream started.</p>
    
    <p>If there is a time in parentheses
    (like <code>1h 30m (2h)</code>), then that time denotes how long the stream
    was online, but including small offline periods (PICNICs) of at most 10 minutes,
    which means that this time is more of a guess of what might be expected as
    stream online time and also depends on when Chatty got the data (if you join
    the channel after a PICNIC, then it won't include the time before, because it
    never received the data for it).</p>
    
    <h3>History Graph</h3>
    <p>The History is a graph that shows the development of the viewers
                    of the currently active channel and also indicates stream status changes
                    (online/offline/title/game) by different colors.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Range</strong> means only the last <em>x hours</em>
                        are being displayed. For example if the whole data spans 10 hours
                        you can choose to only display the last 2 hours. This will display
                        the <em>maximum range</em> after the <em>actual range</em>
                        (even if the <em>actual range</em> isn't as long as the
                        <em>maximum range</em>):<br />
                        <code>15:32 - 19:14 (2h)</code><br />
                        You can change this via the context menu.
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px"><strong>Fixed Start/End</strong> means that either
                    the beginning of the displayed data is fixed or both the
                    beginning and end of the data are fixed, meaning that the
                    displayed graph will never change. The times that show the
                    <em>actual range</em> indicate whether they are fixed:<br />
                    <code>|15:58| - 19:14</code> or <code>|15:58| - |18:20|</code><br />
                    Double-click on a point to set it as a fixed start, then
                    double-click on another point to set it as a fixed end.
                    Double-click anywhere else to clear fixed start/end.

                <p>The shown data usually fits to the available vertical space
                (so if the min/max viewercounts were 341/403 then only this

    <h2>
        <a name="notifications">Live Streams / Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty can show Notifications when the status of a stream changes.
        There is also a Live Streams window (<code>Channels - Live Channels</code>)
        that shows the currently live streams. Both these features always include channels you have
        joined and - if enabled - channels you have followed. Streams that are
        no longer online, or whose channels you have left and you don't follow,
        are added to a list that you can open in the Live Streams window context
        menu (<code>Removed streams..</code>).</p>
    
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Chatty Notifications are little info boxes that can be shown for stream
    status changes and highlighted messages. When you left-click on a notification
    it is closed immediately, right-clicking closes it as well and in addition
    also joins the associated channel.</p>
    
    <div class="moreInfo">More information: <a href="help-settings.html#Notifications">Notification Settings</a></div>
    
    <h3><a name="followed">Followed Streams</a></h3>
    <p>Chatty can request a list of streams you follow on a regular basis, so
    you have both an overview of currently live streams as well as be
    informed about status changes (offline -> online, title change, game change).
    This is always available for streams whose channels you have joined in chat,
    but with this feature enabled, this works for all streams you follow even
    without joining their channel.</p>
    <p>This feature requires <code>Read user info</code> access, so Chatty can
        request your followed streams. Read the <a href="#login">section about login</a>
    to learn more about login data and access.</p>
    <p>You can enable/disable this feature in the Settings under <code>Notifications</code>.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You can open a list of the <em>Followers</em> of a channel by joining that channel
        and then opening the Followers Dialog via <code>Extra - Followers</code>.
    It always opens on the currently active channel, or if you are in no channel
    at all, your own channel.</p>
    
    <p>You can open a list of your <em>Subscribers</em> by opening the Subscribers Dialog
        via <code>Extra - Subscribers</code>. It always opens on your own channel,
    because you can only display the Subscribers of your own channel. If you don't
    have any Subscribers, it will simply show an empty list (and an error). You
    also need to have selected the necessary <a href="#login">access</a> when
    requesting login data.</p>
    
    <p>You can save the current list to a file by right-clicking on the dialog
    (not the list) and selecting the format.</p>
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Both the Followers and Subscribers Dialog otherwise work in pretty much
        the same way. Data is only requested as long as you have the dialog open. It
        is requested in a semi-regular interval and then displays that data in the
        list (and some stats).</p>
    <p>If followers/following is mentioned below, then the same applies for
    subscribers/subscribing in the appropriate dialog.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">
                <p>At the top it shows some stats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total:</strong> The total number of followers (not to be confused
                    with the followers shown in the list, which are the most recent 100).
                    After the total number, it shows the change compared
                    to the last update, e.g. <code>Total: 3.190 (+2)</code>,
                    which will stay there until the next update.</li>
                    <li><strong>Week/Day/Hour:</strong> These are some stats based
                    on the current list shown below. It shows how many followers
                    there are in the list that followed in the last 7 days (Week), 24 hours (Day) and
                    60 minutes (Hour). (So <em>Day</em> does NOT mean <em>Today</em>
                    as in since 0:00.)<br /><br />
                    If it says <code>99+</code> it means that there are more than
                    99 followers in that timespan, but Chatty can't determine whether
                    it's 100 or more than 100, because the list only contains the
                    100 most recent followers.</li>

    <h3>About New Followers/Refollows</h3>
    <p>Everything that determines whether a follower is new or a refollow is
    saved per session. So if you restart Chatty, it assumes that all followers
    except from the first request are new. So if you start Chatty, open the
    Followers Dialog on your channel, it will load the followers for the first
    time and show none of them as new. Now if it updates a minute later, and there
    are users it hasn't seen as having followed before, then it assumes these
    users as new followers.</p>
    
    <p>Now a user of course might have been a follower for a year, then unfollow
        and follow again. Chances are that Chatty won't notice that and assume a new
        follower. What it however does is that it only shows each user as new follower
        <em>once per session</em>. So if someone follows and Chatty shows that user as a new follower,
        then that user unfollows and follows again, Chatty will notice that the first
        and the second follow time are different, and will show this user as a refollow
        (the name slightly grey).</p>
    
    <p>So this basicially just prevents the same user from e.g. making a sound
        go off (if you have that enabled) several times just by refollowing several
        times. At most that will happen once per session. Other than that
        the data is mostly shown just as it comes in from Twitch. It will still
        show refollows on the top of the list.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="streamhighlights">Stream Highlights</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty can help you with creating Highlights of your stream by recording
    the stream time (how long the stream has been online) using a command or
    hotkey. When you add a Stream Highlight in Chatty, it is written to a file
    which you can then view later.</p>
    
    <p>The following commands are available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/addStreamHighlight [comment]</code> - Adds a highlight at
        the current time, with a comment if you want to.</li>
        <li><code>/openStreamHighlights</code> - Opens the file where the stream
        highlights are stored in your default text editor.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can also add a hotkey to add stream highlights, so you can also do it
    yourself while streaming out of a game (given that global hotkeys work in
    the game).</p>
    
    <p>The highlights are written to the file <code>stream_highlights.txt</code>
        in the <code>exported</code> subfolder of the settings directory (which
        you can open with the <code>/openDir</code> and show with the
        <code>/dir</code> command).</p>
    
    <h3>Allow your moderators to add highlights</h3>
    <p>You can also let your moderators add stream highlights
        (<code>!highlight [comment]</code>), but you first have to set the channel with a
        <a href="help-setting_commands.html#streamhighlights">setting command</a>:</p>
    
    <dl class="defList">
        <dt><code>/set streamHighlightChannel #&lt;yourchannelname&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>Allows moderators in the given channel to run the command.</dd>
        <dd>For example if your channel/stream is called <code>zoton2</code> the
            command you have to enter would be: <code>/set&nbsp;streamHighlightChannel&nbsp;#zoton2</code></dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Optionally you can also set the following settings:</p>
    <dl class="defList">
        <dt><code>/set streamHighlightChannelRespond 1</code></dt>
        <dd>Send a response to chat when the mod command is used (otherwise the
            message is just shown locally).</dd>
        <dt><code>/set streamHighlightCommand !highlight</code></dt>
        <dd>Change the mod command (in this example to <code>!highlight</code>,
            which is the default)</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p><em>Tip:</em> <a href="help-setting_commands.html">Setting commands</a>
        are entered into the chat input box, just like Twitch Chat commands.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Using the <code>/proc</code> command you can start processes directly out
        of Chatty. An example of where this is already integrated into Chatty is
        starting Livestreamer, however this is a more basic implementation.
        <em>This is probably only interesting for advanced users.</em></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><code>/proc exec &lt;command and parameters&gt;</code> - Try to
            start a process on your computer.</li>
        <li><code>/proc list</code> - List of processes currently running out of
            Chatty.</li>
        <li><code>/proc kill &lt;id&gt;</code> - Forcefully end the process with
            the given id (get the id from the list of processes).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Example: <code>/proc exec notepad H:\hl.txt</code> will start Notepad
        and open the given file.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> Commands and output of the process is logged in the Debug Log which
        is written to file and output to <code>Extra&nbsp;-&nbsp;Debug window</code>.</p>
