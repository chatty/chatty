    <h2>
        <a name="title">Title and Tabs</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <img src="0_4_overview_top.png" alt="Top of the main Chatty window, explaining the data in the title and the meaning of TAB colors" />
    <p>When in a channel, Chatty shows some information about that channel
    in the titlebar, e.g.:<br /><cite>[40|59] - GTA:SA Speedruns (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas)</cite></p>
    <p>The first number is the number of people in the chat, the second is the
    viewercount, followed by the current stream title and game. Anything other
    than the number of people in the chat is requested from the Twitch API about
    every two minutes.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, the titlebar will also show additional information, if enabled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Sub</code> for Subscriber-Only Mode</li>
        <li><code>Slow: &lt;time&gt;</code> for Slowmode</li>
        <li><code>R9k</code> for R9Kbeta Mode</li>
        <li><code>EmoteOnly</code> for Emote-Only Mode</li>
        <li><code>Shield</code> if Shield Mode is enabled (moderators only)</li>
        <li>A language code if Broadcaster Language Mode is enabled</li>
        <li><code>[FM]</code> indicates a websocket connection (<code>F</code>
            for FrankerFaceZ, <code>M</code> for PubSub/Modlogs)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can toggle showing some information under <code>View - Options - Titlebar</code>.</p>
    
    <p>Note that the stream status (title/game, offline) can take a few minutes
        to update, since it has to be requested from the Twitch API (which is
        also heavily cached).</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="layouts">Layouts and Tabs</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>A layout is the arrangement of tabs in the Chatty window and popouts,
        which can be saved and restored later. Other GUI elements that aren't a
        tab (e.g. the Settings Dialog or Emotes Dialog) are not considered a
        part of a layout in this sense, so their location and size is determined
        in other ways.</p>
    
    <p>You can open several tabs, which can be of basicially two different types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Channels and Whisper Tabs, which open as tabs by default.</li>
        <li>Docked Dialogs, which open as a separate dialog by default, but can
            be docked as a tab through their context menu (usually right-click).
            This includes for example the Channel Info, Admin Panel and more.
            <br /><br />
            Note that these will only be considered as being part of the layout
            when in their docked state. When not docked, these dialogs will use
            the old system, which is affected by the settings under "Main - Settings - Window - Dialogs Location/Size".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use drag&amp;drop on tabs in various ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Move a tab within the same tab pane to change their order.</li>
        <li>Move a tab to another tab pane.</li>
        <li>Drop a tab in the middle of another tab pane to move it to that tab
            pane.</li>
        <li>Drop a tab on the side of another tab pane to create a split pane,
            containing two tab panes side-by-side.</li>
        <li>Drop a tab outside of any Chatty window to open it in a popout
            (depending on the settings under "Main - Settings - Tabs").</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also open the tab context menu (right-click) to perform various
        actions such as opening a popout or closing the tab.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="layouts-save-load">Save and Load Layouts</a></h3>
    <p>You can save the current tabs, splits and popouts in a layout under
        "View - Layouts". Saving a layout is a snapshot of the current state, so
        if you make any changes that you wish to be saved, you'll have to save
        it again (add a new layout or overwrite an existing one).</p>
    
    <p>If enabled ("Main - Settings - Main") the layout will automatically be
        restored when restarting Chatty, which is separate from saving layouts
        manually.</p>
    
    <p>Aside from loading layouts through the menu, you can also use commands:</p>
    
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt><code>/layouts add &lt;name&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>Add a new layout with the current state. If the layout already
            exists, you will be asked whether you want to overwrite it. Example:
            <code>/layouts add abc</code></dd>
        
        <dt><code>/layouts save &lt;name&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>Adds a new layout with the current state or overwrites it if the
            layout already exists (without asking).</dd>
        
        <dt><code>/layouts remove &lt;name&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>Removes the given layout.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>/layouts load [-clm] &lt;name&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>Loads the given layout.</dd>
        <dd>If no options are given (e.g. <code>/layouts load abc</code>) it
            will open the load layout dialog.</dd>
        <dd>Options can be given to define how to load the layout, which also
            loads the layout immediately without showing the dialog. The options
            are equivalent to what you can select in the dialog:
            <ul>
                <li><code>c</code> to keep the current channels open</li>
                <li><code>l</code> to open the channels from the layout</li>
                <li><code>m</code> to load the main window location/size</li>
            </ul>
            For example <code>/layouts load -c abc</code> keeps the current channels
            open, but does not join the channels in the layout. The options can
            also be empty, for example <code>/layouts load - abc</code> will not
            open any channels or keep any channels open (but the rest of the
            layout such as docked dialogs is still loaded).
        </dd>
        <dd>You can use <code>/layouts load -- -abc</code> if your layout name
            begins with a <code>-</code> (in this case "-abc"), which opens the
            dialog just as if you hadn't provided any options at all.</dd>

        <a name="login">Twitch Login</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The login data consists of a <em>username</em> (your account name) and most
        importantly an <em>access token</em>, which is sort of a revokable
        password that can also have different types of access (scopes) associated with
        it. You can see the full list of associated scopes under "Main - Account"
        (hover over each entry for more information if available).</p>
    
    <p>If getting login data fails, read <a href="help-guide2.html">this guide</a>.
        If your login was determined invalid, read <a href="#login-invalid">down below</a>.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="access">Add or remove access</a></h3>
    <p>To change what Chatty is allowed to do, you need to request a new
        access token. Go to <code>&lt;Main - Account&gt;</code>,
        delete the login and request it again with the access scopes that you
        want.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="login-security">Security</a></h3>
    <p>The access token is saved in the <code>login</code> file in the settings
        <a href="help-guide_folders.html">directory</a> and can thus be accessed
        by anyone having access to your computer.
    It allows anyone who obtains it to chat in your name and do the other things
    that you have allowed Chatty to do. If you think the token may have been
    compromised, please immediately go to your Twitch Settings subsection
    <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections">Connections</a>
    and <em>revoke the accesss</em> there. This will make all tokens previously
    requested for Chatty associated with that account invalid. You can then
    request a new one for which Twitch will ask you to authorize Chatty again.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="login-invalid">Invalid Login</a></h3>
    <p>If your login is determined invalid (either by checking it manually or
    when Chatty performed an automatic check), this can mean one of two things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your login is actually still valid, Twitch is just derping:
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes the Twitch API won't recognize any login as valid,
                    for a while. This is likely the reason if other users have
                    the same issue at the same time.</li>
                <li>How to proceed:
                <ul>
                    <li>In this case, requesting new login data from Twitch probably
                        won't help at all. Go to <code>&lt;Main - Account&gt;</code>
                        to open the <code>Login configuration</code> and click on <code>[Verify login]</code> a few times
                        (with a few minutes in between attempts).</li>
                    <li>If you are already connected to chat, you can just stay
                        connected. Just try <code>[Verify login]</code> a bit later to
                        be able to use the features that require Twitch
                        authorization again.</li>
                    <li>If <code>[Verify login]</code> keeps returning invalid,
                        even after a while (especially without other users
                        having the same issue), your login may actually be
                        invalid.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your login is actually invalid:
            <ul>
                <li>You have just requested login data and something went wrong, or it
                    wasn't loaded properly from the settings.</li>
                <li>The token was invalidated for some other reason.</li>
                <li>How to proceed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Go to <code>&lt;Main - Account&gt;</code> to open
                            the login configuration (if you don't already have
                            it open), click <code>[Remove login]</code>
                            and create a new login.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>What happens when your login is no longer valid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can't connect to chat anymore. If you are already connected, you
            probably stay connected though.</li>
        <li>Various features that require authentication may not work anymore,
            such as showing live streams you follow or changing your stream
            title.</li>

    <h3>Channel list format</h3>
    <p>In places where you can enter a channel name you can specify several
        channels by separating them with a comma. Channels can be entered with
        or without leading <code>#</code>. A lot of Twitch links should also
        work.</p>
    
    <p>Various special elements can be added that are turned into channels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can include <a href="help-addressbook.html">Addressbook</a> categories,
            e.g. <code>[vip]</code> to join all entries associated with the
            "vip" category. Can restrict to just channel entries <code>[vip #]</code>
            (would only get Addressbook entries such as "#joshimuz") or
            non-channel entries <code>[vip !#]</code> (entries such as "joshimuz").
            Note that both channel entries and non-channel entries are otherwise
            handled the same, both would join "#joshimuz" in this example.</li>
        <li>Instead of Addressbook categories <code>[*]</code> can be used for all
            favorited channels (favorited under "Channels - Favorites / History").</li>
        <li>Can also restrict to just live channels e.g. <code>[vip live]</code>,
            <code>[vip # live]</code> or <code>[* live]</code> (only works for
            live channels Chatty already knows the status for, such as followed
            channels).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Example: <code>/join #joshimuz, esl_csgo, [mod], https://twitch.tv/esamarathon, [* live]</code></p>
        (joins <code>#joshimuz</code>, <code>#esl_csgo</code>, any entries
        associated with the <code>mod</code> Addressbook category, <code>#esamarathon</code>
        and any favorited channels that are live and followed)

        <a name="symbols">User Status Symbols</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>There are a few special symbols that are used for users in chat. These
    are displayed in the userlist and - if usericons are disabled - also in chat:</p>
    
    <table class="compact" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tr>

            <td>Staff, Admin</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>When you copy&amp;paste a message from chat that contains Badges, you may
        also encounter the following symbols:</p>
    
    <table class="compact" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tr>
            <td class="symbol">'</td>
            <td>Addon Usericon</td>

            <td class="symbol">?</td>
            <td>Unknown Badge (for example special Twitch Badges that may only
                be available for some time or in some channels)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p><a href="https://frankerfacez.com">FrankerFaceZ</a> provides a custom
    mod icon for some channels. You can disable this in the settings if you
    want to keep the default one for all channels.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="userlist">Userlist</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The userlist on the side of the channel shows all users currently
        considered to be in the channel.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A user gets added to the userlist..
            <ul>
                <li>..when the user says something in chat.</li>
                <li>..when Chatty receives a JOIN from Twitch Chat for that user (or
                    that user is on the received NAMES list).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A user gets removed from the userlist..
            <ul>
                <li>..when Chatty receives a PART from Twitch Chat for that user.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The userlist gets cleared entirely..
            <ul>
                <li>..when you close the channel (close the Tab).</li>
                <li>..when you rejoin the channel (e.g. when reconnecting).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In order to receive JOIN/PART messages, the setting <code>Correct Userlist</code>
        under <code>Settings - Advanced - Connection</code> has to be enabled.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> The userlist is not very reliable and should only be taken
        as a rough estimate of who is currently in the channel. This is because:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>JOIN/PART messages are sent in batches and can be pretty delayed, so
        so it may happen that a user who only just started showing up in the
        userlist joined half a minute ago (or even already left again).</li>
        <li>It can take some time for Twitch to send the userlist when you join
        a channel. In big channels it may not be sent at all.</li>
        <li>MOD/UNMOD messages are unreliable as well, so mod status in the
        userlist may not always be correct. Twitch Chat has also been known to
        sometimes spam MOD/UNMOD messages.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Also note that the userlist doesn't necessarily have to do with who
        watches your stream. A user can be logged into chat without watching the
        stream and vice versa. Overall, just don't take the userlist too
        seriously.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="TAB_Completion">TAB Completion</a><a name="nickCompletion"></a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>When typing in the inputbox, you can use the following keys by default
        (this can be changed in the <a href="help-settings.html#Completion">Completion settings</a>):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>TAB</kbd> to complete usernames</li>
        <li><kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to complete Emoticons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a completion is initiated, <kbd>TAB</kbd> and <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd>
        cycle forwards and backward through the results, or use the mouse.</p>

    <p>Some prefixes always force a certain completion type (whether you use
        <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd>):</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Prefixing <code>@</code> completes usernames (e.g. <code>@jo</code>)</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>/</code> completes command names</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>:</code> completes Emoji codes, and by default also Twitch Emotes (can be changed in the settings)</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>.</code> performs <a href="help-settings.html#TAB_Completion-custom">Custom completion</a></li>
        <li>Certain commands such as <code>/ban</code> complete usernames for
            their first parameter</li>
        <li>Setting commands such as <code>/set</code> complete setting names
            for their first parameter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Additionally, some prefixes will automatically initiate completion (this
        too can be changed in the settings).</p>
    
    <h3>Further usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use <kbd>TAB</kbd> to cycle <em>forward</em> through results and
            <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to cycle <em>backwards</em> through results</li>
        <li>Continue typing, send the message or move the cursor to end completion</li>
        <li>Click on a result to choose it, or <kbd>Shift</kbd>-Click to insert
            several results</li>
        <li>Press ESC to go back to before completion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The found matches are all ordered alphabetically, except for nickcompletion
    for which you can choose different types of sorting. By default nicknames use
    predictive sorting, which means users who recently wrote a message or highlighted
    you have a higher priority, increasing the chance that the users you want to
    address appear as the first few matches.</p>
    
    <h3>Example: Nick Completion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter <code>z</code> in the editbox</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to complete as a nickname (assuming the <a href="help-settings.html#Completion">setting</a> is that)
            <ul>
                <li>On default settings, this may complete to <code>ze_tt</code>
                with two other results</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cycle through to <code>zMASKm</code> by:
            <ul>
                <li>Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd>, which cycles fowards to <code>zMASKm</code></li>
                <li>Or press <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to cycle backwards to <code>zeblover</code>
                    and <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> again to cycle to <code>zMASKm</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Example: Emote Completion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter <code>dat</code> in the editbox</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to complete as an emote (assuming the <a href="help-settings.html#Completion">setting</a> is that)
            <ul>
                <li>On default settings, this may complete to <code>DatHass</code> with two other results</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cycle through to <code>DatSheffy</code> by:
            <ul>
                <li>Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd>, which cycles fowards to <code>DatSaunce</code>
                    and <kbd>TAB</kbd> again to cycle to <code>DatSheffy</code></li>
                <li>Or press <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to cycle backwards
                    to <code>DatSheffy</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <a name="inputHistory">Input History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Chatty provdes an input history for the chat input box that allows you to
    call up lines you entered previously, to make it easier to e.g. repeat
    commands with similiar parameters, repeat messages you send to chat or just
    look up what you wrote before. You can even save messages to the history
    that you haven't send yet to be able to send them later.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> On a multiline inputbox you have to hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
        to navigate through the Input History (changeable in Chat Settings).</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>How lines are saved in the history:
            <ul>
                <li>Send a message or enter a command</li>
                <li>Press <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> after entering/editing a message
                (which saves it to the history, but also clears the input box)</li>
                <li>Identical lines already in the history are removed (or you
                can think of it being moved to the latest position)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Using the history:
            <ul>
                <li>You can navigate backwards and forwards through the history by
                    pressing <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd>.</li>
                <li>Pressing <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> when you already entered some
                text replaces that with the latest history item.</li>
                <li>Pressing <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> when you already entered some
                text clears the input box and but also saves what you entered to
                the history (as mentioned above).</li>
                <li>When you navigated to a history item and edited it:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pressing <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> will move to the previous
                            history item, allowing you to then press <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd>
                        again to go back to the unedited history item</li>
                        <li>Pressing <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> will act as if you
                        entered a completely new line and add the edited item
                        to the history and clear the input box</li>

        via the Emote Context Menu (right-click on an emote in the dialog or chat and
        choose <code>Favorite</code>, emotes that already are favorited can be
        removed from favorites the same way).</li>
        <li>The <code>My Emotes</code> page lists the emotes you paid for (Subemotes/Turbo).</li>
        <li>The <code>Channel</code> page lists the emotes that are specific to the current channel
        (FFZ and BTTV, if there are any). It also includes

    can use them or not (but it displays a message if you are not subscribed).</li>
        <li>The <code>Twitch</code> page shows all free global Twitch emotes</li>
        <li>The <code>Other</code> page shows all global FZZ/BTTV emotes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Click on an emote to insert it into the current channel inputbox. Double-click
        on an emote to also close the Emote Dialog in the process, or press <kbd>ESC</kbd> or
    <kbd>Ctrl-E</kbd> to close it. Right-click on an emote to show a context menu
    with some more information/options.</p>
    
    <p>Right-click on an emote and choose <code>Show Details</code> to open the
    Detail View in the Emote Dialog, which shows the emote in different sizes
    and some information about it. Clicking on an emote in chat also opens the
    Detail View.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note that you need to have joined at least one channel for your subemotes/turbo emotes
        to show up, because only then does Twitch Chat send that information to the client.</em></p>

MiniK   http://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/25/1.0     set:793 id:3287</pre>
        
        <p>This can be used to replace existing emotes, since custom emotes are
        checked first and thus take precedence. This is not intended to replace
        FFZ or BTTV emotes, just to help configure emotes to your personal
        preference. For example you could also add an image for you own name to
        have it highlighted in chat in a different way.</p>
        
        <p><em>Note:</em> The <code>emotes.txt</code> should be saved in the
            UTF-8 encoding (or ASCII I guess).</p>
        
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        
        <p>The syntax per line is (you can use as many spaces or TABs as seperators as you want):</p>
        
        <p><code>[settings] &lt;code&gt; [settings] &lt;image&gt; [settings]</code></p>
        
        <p>Settings can be in any of the shown places, but are always optional. Available settings are:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><code>set:&lt;setid&gt;</code> to specify a
        Twitch emote set. This will only affect messages you write yourself.</li>
            <li><code>id:&lt;emoteid&gt;</code> to specify a Twitch emote id to
            replace. This will only affect incoming messages.</li>
            <li><code>chan:&lt;channel&gt;</code> to restrict the emote to the
            given channel.</li>
            <li><code>size:&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</code> to specify the
            size of the emote (you can omit this if you want to use the image
            size).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>code</strong> can be prefixed with <code>re:</code>
            to specify a regular expression. Otherwise it is interpreted as plain text
            (the same as regular Twitch emotes, case-sensitive and usually separated
            by space from other characters).</li>
            <li>The <strong>image file</strong> is relative to the settings directory (where you created
            the <code>emotes.txt</code> in), so just put them in the same directory.
        You should also be able to use URLs to load the image from the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Lines starting with <code>#</code> are ignored and can be used for comments.</p>
        
        <p>The <code>emotes.txt</code> file is loaded when you start Chatty, so if you edit the file
            while Chatty is running, you have to use the <code>/reloadCustomEmotes</code>
            command for it to take effect.
        Emote images may be cached, so if you change the image, you MAY have to
        clear the cache (<code>/clearemotecache CUSTOM</code>).</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>With this feature, you can select a user in chat with keyboard shortcuts
    (if the window is active). So you can e.g. timeout a user with your keyboard
    alone.</p>
    
    <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl-Space</kbd> (can be changed in the settings) to enter
        this mode. If there are any user
    messages in chat, then the newest message will get another background color
    which shows that it is selected. In that mode, the focus is on the textpane,
    which enables more shortcuts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>W</kbd> to move up a user</li>
        <li><kbd>S</kbd> to move down a user</li>
        <li><kbd>A</kbd> to move up twice</li>
        <li><kbd>D</kbd> to move down twice</li>
        <li><kbd>Q</kbd> to quit out of the mode</li>
        <li><kbd>E</kbd> to open the User Dialog for the currently selected user</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When you move up and down, it actually switches to the next user instead
    of to the next line. So if the same user send 10 messages in a row, it will
    jump to the first message of the next user above it.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to the currently selected message, it will also highlight all
        other messages by the same user. You can also hold <kbd>AltGr</kbd> and
    click on a username in chat to highlight all that users messages (and enter
    User Selection Mode).</p>
    
    <p>You can also click and hold in an empty area of the textpane, which puts
    and holds the focus there, so you can just use the shortcuts in the list
    above to enter the User Selection Mode and switch between messages. However
    if you let go of the mouse key, it will immediately leave the mode again.</p>
    
    <h3>Using Global Hotkeys</h3>
    <p>You can also configure global hotkeys with some User Selection actions.
    However, if the focus is not on the chat, then the usual shortcuts won't
    work, so you'll have to define additional global hotkeys to e.g. timeout the
    currently selected user. See the hotkey settings for what actions are
    available.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
        <p>Stream Chat is a separate dialog, opened via the <code>/openStreamChat</code>
            command or the <code>Extra</code> menu, which is different from normal chats:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Can contain messages from one or several channels at once (only regular chat messages, no info messages)</li>
            <li>Messages can be automatically removed after a certain time</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>For chat messages to appear in the Stream Chat, you have to both
            enable the channel and join the channel in Chatty normally.</p>
        
        <p>You can enable channels in the Stream Chat context menu (which will
            offer to enable currently joined channels) or use the
            following setting commands (channel all-lowercase):</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><code>/set streamChatChannels #&lt;channel&gt;</code> - To set
            the channel to only this one</li>
            <li><code>/add streamChatChannels #&lt;channel&gt;</code> - To add
            a channel</li>
            <li><code>/remove streamChatChannels #&lt;channel&gt;</code> - To remove
            a channel</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Other settings</h3>
        
        <dl class="defList">
            <dt><code>/set streamChatLogos &lt;size&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Set the channel logo size (pixels). Set to <code>0</code> to disable.</dd>
            <dd>Logos are only shown for channels that have been live during the
                current session. Changes only affect new messages.</dd>
            
            <dt><code>/set streamChatMessageTimeout &lt;seconds&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>How long messages are displayed before they disappear. Set to
                <code>-1</code> to disable.</dd>
            
            <dt><code>/set streamChatBottom &lt;0/1&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Disable so messages start being inserted at the top.</dd>
            <dd>Restart required to apply changes.</dd>
            
            <dt><code>/set streamChatResizable &lt;0/1&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Whether Stream Chat dialog should be resizable.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>In addition, make sure you have <code>Settings - Window - Restore dialogs</code>
            set to at least <code>Restore dialogs from last session</code> in order
            to keep the position/size of the Stream Chat dialog between sessions.</p>
        
        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>/openStreamChat</code> - Opens the Stream Chat dialog</li>
            <li><code>/setStreamChatSize &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</code> - Set the exact size of the Stream Chat dialog in pixels</li>
            <li><code>/getStreamChatSize</code> - Shows the size of the Stream Chat dialog in pixels</li>
            <li><code>/clearStreamChat</code> - Removes all messages</li>
            <li><code>/streamChatTest [message]</code> - Adds a test message to the Stream Chat dialog, if you don't specify a message
            a default one is used</li>

    <h2>
        <a name="customNames">Custom Names</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You can give people in chat custom names that will appear in chat and
    in the userlist instead of the regular Twitch username and in the User Info
    Dialog in addition to the regular Twitch username. In other places (like
    the User Context Menu) the regular Twitch username is used.</p>
    
    <p>TAB Completion also allows you to complete Custom Names and by default
        also includes the original name in the results.</p>
    
    <p>The following commands are used to set custom names:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/setname &lt;username&gt; &lt;custom name&gt;</code> - to set a custom name</li>
        <li><code>/resetname &lt;username&gt;</code> - to remove a custom name</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In addition to these commands, you can also view and change Custom Names
        via the Settings GUI under <code>Names</code>. You can also right-click
        on a user in chat to open the User Context Menu and choose
        <code>Miscellaneous - Set name</code> to open the Settings with the name
        preset.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="pausechat">Pause Chat / One-click moderation</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If enabled in the settings under <code>Main - Settings - Chat</code> you
        can stop the chat from scrolling down while you move the mouse over chat.
        This can prevent misclicks when the chat is moving. The chat will resume
        scrolling down as soon as you stop moving the mouse or move it out of
        the chat area. When the chat is already paused, you can also hold
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to keep the chat paused even without moving the mouse.</p>

    <p>Optionally, you can set it to require <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> being pressed in
        conjunction with moving the mouse to initiate pausing. You can let go of
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> as soon as pausing is started and it will stay paused as
        long as you move the mouse inside the chat area.</p>
    
    <p>A little popup in the top-right will indicate that the chat is paused.</p>
    
    <p><em>Please note:</em> This only works when the chat area is already filled, so the scrollbar is
        actually used. In addition, there may be instances where something you
        want to click will move anyway, for example if a message is deleted due
        to a timeout/ban, causing other messages to move.</p>
    
    <h3>Scroll up to stop scrolling</h3>
    <p>Another way of preventing scrolling down is scrolling up. Once you are
        manually scrolled up, chat will stop scrolling down automatically.
        However messages may still be removed from the buffer causing the chat
        to move despite it not actively scrolling down. It will stop removing
        messages to get moving to a minimum as long as you keep holding
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.</p>
    
    <p>A certain time after not moving the scroll position, it will scroll down
        automatically (unless <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is still being pressed).</p>
    
    <h3>One-click moderation</h3>
    <p>Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and clicking on a user in chat can execute a ban
        or timeout on that user. Enable this feature and define what it does in
        the settings (<code>Main - Settings - Chat</code>).</p>
    
    <p>It is recommended to enable the pause chat feature if you are using this,
        or else misclicks could be very common.</p>

    <p><a href="https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2662186-how-to-use-automod">AutoMod</a>
        is a Twitch feature that filters messages before they are send to the
        chat clients. As mod in the channel you can review and either approve
        or deny those filtered messages in different ways:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The AutoMod Dialog under <code>Extra - AutoMod</code></li>
        <li>Enable <code>Settings - Moderation - Show messages rejected by AutoMod</code>
            to show rejected messages directly in chat and..
            <ul>
                <li>Right-click on the username of a filtered message and
                    approve/reject from the context menu</li>
                <li>Click on the username of a filtered message to open the User
                    Info Dialog and click the approve/reject button
                    (<a href="help-custom_commands.html#special-commands">settings</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>AutoMod Dialog</h3>
    <p>In the dialog you will see filtered messages of the current channel (if
        you are mod). Open the context menu on a message (usually right-click)
        to approve or deny that message. Double-click on a message to open the
        User Info Dialog for that user to be able to see his previous messages
        or ban/timeout the user.</p>
    
    <p>Shortcuts available when you have a message selected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>A</kbd> to approve, <kbd>D</kbd> to deny message</li>
        <li><kbd>W</kbd> to move up in the list, <kbd>Alt+W</kbd> to jump over

        <li><kbd>S</kbd> to move down in the list, <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> to jump over
            already handled messages</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Messages can have different prefixes depending on their status:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No prefix - The message has not been approved/denied yet</li>
        <li><code>Approved</code> - You have approved the message</li>
        <li><code>Denied</code> - You have denied the message</li>
        <li><code>Handled</code> - The message has been handled already,
            probably by another mod (the API does not return whether it's been
            approved or denied)</li>
        <li><code>Pending</code> - Your action is being sent to the Twitch API</li>
        <li><code>N/A</code> - The message is no longer available to be
            approved or denied (this seems to be the case after a few minutes)</li>
        <li><code>Error</code> - An error occured sending your action to the
            Twitch API</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Messages that have already been handled or that are older than 5 minutes
        (and can thus <em>probably</em> not be approved/denied anymore) are

    <h2>
        <a name="channelinfo">Channel Info / History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The Channel Info Dialog shows the current stream status of the active
    stream. The data is requested from the Twitch API in a semi-regular interval,
    so it can take some time to update.</p>
    
    <h3>Stream Uptime</h3>
    <p>If the stream is online, the <code>Live: 1h 30m</code>
    shows how long ago the stream was started. That time comes directly from the
    Twitch API, so it is able to show the correct online time, even if you started
    Chatty after the stream started.</p>
    
    <p>If there is a time in parentheses
    (like <code>1h 30m (2h)</code>), then that time denotes how long the stream
    was online, but including small offline periods (PICNICs) of at most 10 minutes,
    which means that this time is more of a guess of what might be expected as
    stream online time and also depends on when Chatty got the data (if you join
    the channel after a PICNIC, then it won't include the time before, because it
    never received the data for it).</p>
    
    <h3>History Graph</h3>
    <p>The History is a graph that shows the development of the viewers
                    of the currently active channel and also indicates stream status changes
                    (online/offline/title/game) by different colors.</p>
                <p>Hover over points to display the stream status and viewercount

                        you can choose to only display the last 2 hours. This will display
                        the <em>maximum range</em> after the <em>actual range</em>
                        (even if the <em>actual range</em> isn't as long as the

                    the beginning of the displayed data is fixed or both the

                    displayed graph will never change. The times that show the
                    <em>actual range</em> indicate whether they are fixed:<br />

    <h2>
        <a name="notifications">Live Streams / Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty can show Notifications when the status of a stream changes.
        There is also a Live Streams window (<code>Channels - Live Channels</code>)
        that shows the currently live streams. Both these features always include channels you have
        joined and - if enabled - channels you have followed. Streams that are
        no longer online, or whose channels you have left and you don't follow,
        are added to a list that you can open in the Live Streams window context
        menu (<code>Removed streams..</code>).</p>
    
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Chatty Notifications are little info boxes that can be shown for stream
    status changes and highlighted messages. When you left-click on a notification
    it is closed immediately, right-clicking closes it as well and in addition
    also joins the associated channel.</p>
    
    <div class="moreInfo">More information: <a href="help-settings.html#Notifications">Notification Settings</a></div>
    
    <h3><a name="followed">Followed Streams</a></h3>
    <p>Chatty can request a list of streams you follow on a regular basis, so
    you have both an overview of currently live streams as well as be
    informed about status changes (offline -> online, title change, game change).
    This is always available for streams whose channels you have joined in chat,
    but with this feature enabled, this works for all streams you follow even
    without joining their channel.</p>
    <p>This feature requires <code>Show followed streams</code> access, so Chatty can
        request your followed streams. Read the <a href="#login">section about login</a>
    to learn more about login data and access.</p>
    <p>You can enable/disable this feature in the Settings under <code>Notifications</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="admin">Admin Dialog</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p><em>This has been moved to it's <a href="help-admin.html">own page</a></em></p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="followers">Followers/Subscribers List</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You can open a list of the <em>Followers</em> of a channel by joining that channel
        and then opening the Followers Dialog via <code>Extra - Followers</code>.
    It always opens on the currently active channel, or if you are in no channel
    at all, your own channel.</p>
    
    <p>You can open a list of your <em>Subscribers</em> by opening the Subscribers Dialog
        via <code>Extra - Subscribers</code>. It always opens on your own channel,
    because you can only display the Subscribers of your own channel. If you don't
    have any Subscribers, it will simply show an empty list (and an error). You
    also need to have selected the necessary <a href="#login">access</a> when
    requesting login data.</p>
    
    <p>You can save the current list to a file by right-clicking on the dialog
    (not the list) and selecting the format.</p>
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Both the Followers and Subscribers Dialog otherwise work in pretty much
        the same way. Data is only requested as long as you have the dialog open. It
        is requested in a semi-regular interval and then displays that data in the
        list (and some stats).</p>
    <p>If followers/following is mentioned below, then the same applies for
    subscribers/subscribing in the appropriate dialog.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">
                <p>At the top it shows some stats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total:</strong> The total number of followers (not to be confused
                    with the followers shown in the list, which are the most recent 100).
                    After the total number, it shows the change compared
                    to the last update, e.g. <code>Total: 3.190 (+2)</code>,
                    which will stay there until the next update.</li>
                    <li><strong>Week/Day/Hour:</strong> These are some stats based
                    on the current list shown below. It shows how many followers
                    there are in the list that followed in the last 7 days (Week), 24 hours (Day) and
                    60 minutes (Hour). (So <em>Day</em> does NOT mean <em>Today</em>
                    as in since 0:00.)<br /><br />
                    If it says <code>99+</code> it means that there are more than
                    99 followers in that timespan, but Chatty can't determine whether
                    it's 100 or more than 100, because the list only contains the
                    100 most recent followers.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are different background colors for some entries:</p>

                    <li><span style="background-color:#FFF5D2">New entries</span> (meaning entries
                    that appeared first in the last update)</li>
                    <li><span style="background-color:#FFFAF0">Entries of the last 15 minutes</span></li>

                </ul>
                <p>At the bottom, it shows approximately how long ago data was last received,
                or a short error message if an error occured.</p>
            </td>
            <td valign="top"><img src="followers.jpg" alt="Followers Dialog" /></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>About New Followers/Refollows</h3>
    <p>Everything that determines whether a follower is new or a refollow is
    saved per session. So if you restart Chatty, it assumes that all followers
    except from the first request are new. So if you start Chatty, open the
    Followers Dialog on your channel, it will load the followers for the first
    time and show none of them as new. Now if it updates a minute later, and there
    are users it hasn't seen as having followed before, then it assumes these
    users as new followers.</p>
    
    <p>Now a user of course might have been a follower for a year, then unfollow
        and follow again. Chances are that Chatty won't notice that and assume a new
        follower. What it however does is that it only shows each user as new follower
        <em>once per session</em>. So if someone follows and Chatty shows that user as a new follower,
        then that user unfollows and follows again, Chatty will notice that the first
        and the second follow time are different, and will show this user as a refollow
        (the name slightly grey).</p>
    
    <p>So this basicially just prevents the same user from e.g. making a sound
        go off (if you have that enabled) several times just by refollowing several
        times. At most that will happen once per session. Other than that
        the data is mostly shown just as it comes in from Twitch. It will still
        show refollows on the top of the list.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="streamhighlights">Stream Highlights / Markers</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty can help you with creating Highlights of your stream by recording
    the stream time (how long the stream has been online) using a command or
    hotkey. When you add a Stream Highlight in Chatty, it is written to a file
    which you can then view later.</p>
    
    <p>The following commands are available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/addStreamHighlight [comment]</code> - Adds a highlight at
        the current time, with a comment if you want to.</li>
        <li><code>/openStreamHighlights</code> - Opens the file where the stream
        highlights are stored in your default text editor.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can also add a hotkey to add stream highlights, so you can also do it
    yourself while streaming out of a game (given that global hotkeys work in
    the game).</p>
    
    <p>The highlights are written to the file <code>stream_highlights.txt</code>
        in the <code>exported</code> subfolder of the settings directory (which
        you can open with the <code>/openDir</code> and show with the
        <code>/dir</code> command).</p>
    
    <h3>Chat Command</h3>
    <p>You can also let users in chat (e.g. Mods/VIPs) add Stream Highlights
        (<code>!highlight [comment]</code>), which you can configure under
        <code>Main - Settings - Stream Highlights</code>.</p>
    
    <h3>Stream Markers</h3>
    <p>Twitch offers a way to add
        <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2955281-creating-highlights-and-stream-markers">Stream Markers</a>
        which show up when creating Highlights on the website. You can use the
        <code>/marker</code> command or add a Stream Marker automatically when
        adding a Stream Highlight (changeable in the Stream Highlights settings).</p>
    
    <p>For creating Stream Markers you need the <code>Edit broadcast</code>
        <a href="#login">scope</a>, so if you don't have that yet, you have to
        request a new login token.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Using the <code>/proc</code> command you can start processes directly out
        of Chatty. An example of where this is already integrated into Chatty is
        starting Streamlink, however this is a more basic implementation.</p>
    <p><em>You should only use this if you know what you are doing, running
        system processes can be dangerous if done wrong. Take special care when
        unsafe/unpredictable text is being used, for example from chat messages,
        which may need to be properly quoted/escaped depending on context.</em></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><code>/proc exec &lt;command and parameters&gt;</code> - Try to
            start a process on your computer. The command and parameters are
            split by spaces, unless enclosed by quotes.<br /><br />
            A quote can be escaped by adding a backslash in front <code>\"</code>
            (note that if there is no closing quote, the last quote, even if
            escaped, is used as closing quote). Adding another backslash, e.g.
            <code>\\"</code> will still escape the quote. The debug log shows
            both the original command text and how it was split up.</li>
        <li><code>/proc execEcho &lt;command and parameters&gt;</code> - Same as
            above, but prints the output of the process to the current tab.</li>
        <li><code>/proc list</code> - List of processes currently running out of
            Chatty.</li>
        <li><code>/proc kill &lt;id&gt;</code> - Forcefully end the process with
            the given id (get the id from the list of processes).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Example: <code>/proc exec notepad H:\hl.txt</code> will start Notepad
        and open the given file.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> Commands and output of the process is logged in the Debug Log which
        is written to file and output to <code>Extra&nbsp;-&nbsp;Debug window</code>.</p>
