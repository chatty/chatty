    <h1><a name="top">Using a Bouncer</a></h1>
    <p>Chatty is tailored towards Twitch Chat and is not a general IRC client,
        so using a Bouncer may not work correctly or may cause unexpected
        behaviour. Nevertheless, if you want to try if it works for you, this
        page should get you started.</p>
    
    <h2>Connecting to the Bouncer</h2>
    <p>By default Chatty will connect to the server/ports that are set in the
        settings, using the store OAuth token. To connect to a Bouncer you need
        to change both the server and port and tell Chatty to use the Bouncer
        password instead.</p>
    
    <p>You will need to start Chatty with some <a href="help.html#launch">launch options</a>.
        You can create a <a href="help-guide_create_shortcut.html">shortcut</a>
        or .bat file for that.</p>
    
    <dl class="defList">
        <dt><code>-server &lt;host/ip&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>This will overwrite the Server in the settings for this session (but
            not change the setting). Set this to the IP/Host of your Bouncer.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>-port &lt;port&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>Same as server, set this to the port of your Bouncer.</dd>

        <dt><code>-password [password]</code></dt>
        <dd>Set this to the password of your Bouncer. The password is not saved
            in between sessions which is why you need this option.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>If your bouncer uses special names starting with <code>*</code> like
        <code>*status</code>, this will open an extra Tab in Chatty. You can
        also use the <code>/msg</code> command to directly write to that name
        (e.g. <code>/msg *perform list</code>).</p>
    
    <h2>Configuring the Bouncer</h2>
    <p>You have to configure your Bouncer to connect to Twitch Chat. There are
        probably guides out there how to configure your Bouncer. In regards to
        connecting to Twitch Chat in particular you can use one of the guides
        for regular IRC clients and apply it to the Bouncer.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to that, the Bouncer will need to send the following raw
        commands after connecting to Twitch Chat, which will make it send info
        like usercolors, emotes, user status and much more:</p>
