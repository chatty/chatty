    <h2>
        <a name="0.9.3">Version 0.9.3</a> <a name="latest">(This one!)</a> (2018-12-31)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Custom Message Colors and Highlights can now also apply to Info Messages
        and allow you to set the background color, so it's possible to customize
        the foreground/background of almost any message in the chat window.</p>
    
    <p>Moderators can now delete individual messages and get who performed a
        moderation action directly appended to the associated message.</p>
    
    <pre>
### Chat
- Added ability to customize message background color (through Message Colors
  settings and the "bgcolor:" prefix for Highlights)
- Added prefix "config:info" to Message Colors settings and Highlights as well,
  allowing you to customize the foreground/background color for more messages
  (e.g. `config:info [Notification]` in Msg. Colors to customize the color of
  subscriber notifications)
- Added prefix "config:any" to match both Regular Messages and Info Messages
- Added prefix "config:firstmsg" to only match the first message of a user in
  a channel during the current session
- Added "replacement:none" prefix to Filter list to have no replacement at all

### Moderation
- Added support for deletion of single messages (Delete button automatically
  added to the User Dialog)
- Append which mod performed an action (e.g. ban/timeout), and only show
  separate ModAction message if no associated message is present in chat
- Output ban/timeout reason from Modlogs, since Twitch removed it from chat

### Custom Commands
- Added "/chain" command to perform several commands at once
- Added $(chans) parameter containing all open regular channels
- Added $(msg-id) and $(automod-msg-id) parameters to User Context Menu

- Added "//" prefix to inputbox to directly run anonymous command
  (e.g. `//echo $(chans)`)

### TAB Completion
- Changed TAB Completion for Emoji to search within codes without min. character
  limit, but only search at the beginning of words (separated by underscores)
  and only at the very beginning if already too many matches
- Changed TAB Completion for Emotes/Commands to search at the beginning of words
  as well (capitalized), so e.g. "chair"+TAB will find both "joshChair" and
  "broughyChair" (setting options for previous behaviour or to search anywhere)

### Misc
- Added Splash Screen that shows while Chatty is starting
- Added /marker support to add Stream Markers (also extended Stream Highlights
  feature to add Stream Marker at the same time, added to Settings Dialog)
- Added ability to revoke (not just remove) Login token directly out of Chatty
- Improved debug output
- Improved performance

- Improved Username Color Correction, added several modes to choose from

    <h2>
        <a name="0.9.1">Version 0.9.1</a> (2018-04-02)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This version has a lot of under-the-hood changes to allow for the new
        Rooms feature that Twitch added. The implementation in Chatty is rather
        basic: You can join rooms available for the current channel through the
        "Channels" menu and you can favorite rooms, however for example there is
        not yet an implementation for viewing the Room chat history.</p>
    
    <p>If you're a heavy user of the Highlight system you may appreciate the
        addition of the Highlight Blacklist as well as improvements to the
        dialog used for editing the text matching pattern. Also note that there
        have been slight changes to some prefixes (see below).</p>
    
    <pre>
### Main Features
- Added basic support for Rooms (join via Channels-menu and Favorites/History)
- Added initial support for translating the Chatty GUI to other languages,
  added some partial translations (thanks to volunteers translating)

### Highlighting/Ignore
- Added Highlight Blacklist, to prevent some matches from triggering Highlights
- Improved Highlight pattern tester (used in other places as well), now with
  match color highlighting, and open directly instead of hiding behind "Test"
- Some text matching prefixes changes (Highlighting/Ignore/..):
  - Changed `w:`/`wcs:` to not take Regex anymore
  - Added `reg:` prefix and variations for using Regex with more consistent and
    predictable naming scheme (`re:` and `re*:` still work as before)
  - Invalid regex now won't match any text, instead of just disregarding the
    pattern and matching all text

### Settings
- Setting files `favoritesAndHistory` and `statusPresets` now both merged into
  `settings` file, unused files are removed
- Possibly made saving settings more reliable in some circumstances
- Reorganized Settings Dialog, added new menu for navgiation
- Added setting for vertical zoom in Channel Info Dialog, improved context menu
- Added setting for logging regular chat messages (and thus a way to disable it)
- Added setting whether to show chat inputbox by default (and thus a way to hide
  it by default)
- Added "Off" option for notification type setting
- Updated Livestreamer context menu qualities setting format to allow specifying
  display names for groups of qualities
- Changed TAB Completion default to complete both usernames and emotes with TAB

### Other Changes
- Changed chat inputbox to automatically grow when entering long lines
  (you need to hold Ctrl to navigate input history, changeable in Chat Settings)
- Added /favorite and /unfavorite commands (Channel Favorites)
- Added /joinhosted command to join currently hosted channel
- Changed /appinfo command to contain more information
- Don't add space anymore when chat timestamp is empty
- Show more stream types as "[VOD]" (Premiere, Vodcast, Rerun..)
- Updated help

### Bugfixes
- Fixed bug loading emotes.txt
- Fixed possible Community search issue
- Fixed username capitalization locale bug (e.g. Turkish locale)
- Fixed bug where "Cancel" in the Open URL dialog would sometimes copy the URL
- Fixed possible bug with tray icon

    <h2>
        <a name="0.9">Version 0.9</a> (2017-12-26)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This version includes more Look and Feels which you can select in the
        settings, including some fully dark themes.</p>
    
    <p>There should also be a slight improvement in memory usage and startup
        performance, since not all emote metadata is loaded at once anymore
        (which actually takes up a lot of resources with more than 300k emotes).</p>
    
    <p>Also check out TAB Completion for Emoji, with which you can e.g. enter
        <code>:think</code> and <kbd>TAB</kbd> to complete to <code>:thinking:</code>,
        which when send through the inputbox is replaced with the appropriate
        Emoji character (which is also a new feature).</p>
    
    <pre>
### Twitch Updates
- Added /raid command and display of incoming raids, joining raids doesn't work
- Added support for gifted sub messages

### Look / GUI
- Added more Look and Feels, including dark themes
- Added custom presets to color settings
- Added userlist font setting
- Improved organization and help in Settings Dialog a bit
- Updated Chatty app icons
- Added feature to customize message color based on rules (like Highlighting,
  except it only colors messages)
- Updated help

### Emoticons / Emoji
- Load emoticon metadata only as needed to improve memory usage
- Updated source for subscriber emoticon metadata, fixing e.g. which channel an
  emote is from, added display of emote tiers
- Improved display of information in emote context menu and emote dialog
- Grouped together sets with only one emote in Emote Dialog
- Fixed some BTTV emotes (like D:) appearing when they shouldn't
- Added Emoji TAB Completion (anything starting with ":")
- Added conversion of Emoji short code to Emoji character when entered into the
  inputbox (e.g. :thinking: -> &lt;unicode_character&gt; when being sent)

### Settings
- Added -d launch argument to directly specify settings directory
- Added ability to execute program for Notifications (e.g. run native Linux
  notification)
- Added ability to change spamProtection setting without restart
- Added F1 to open help to settings (instead of it being hardcoded)
- Added "log ignored messages" setting, to be able to turn that off (by default
  it does log them, as before)
- Added more timestamp options to the settings (anything can be set via setting
  commands anyway, but that's not very accessible)
- Improve setting commands

### Bugfixes
- Fixed bug with separators in custom context menus
- Fixed some emote code conversions
- Fixed error on "Use title only" in Admin Dialog
- Possibly fixed rare error with parsing livestreamer menu options

    <h2>
        <a name="0.8.7">Version 0.8.7</a> (2017-09-12)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This update finally contains the ability to set the three communities. It
        has been in beta for a while, but unfortunately I seem to be pretty bad
        at releasing frequent updates, sorry about that (following job interview
        cliché I guess I would have to say it's because I'm a perfectionist ;).
        Due to that, there are also some more changes in this update than usual,
        that have collected over time.</p>
    
    <p>A note about memory usage and emoticons: With the number of emotes
        skyrocketing due to the introduction of the Affiliate program, Chatty
        has much more emote metadata (not images) to handle, which causes issues
        for some users. It needs that data to populate the Emote Dialog and also
        (for sent messages) to show emotes in chat. I will try to improve the
        situation over the coming updates, probably by only requesting data as
        needed, instead of all at once (although there are related issues to
        solve for this to work properly).</p>
    
    <pre>
### Communities / Channel Info
- Added support for selecting several communities in Admin Dialog
- Removed F hotkey for toggling Community favorites (because that can interfere
  with searching the list), use Alt+F instead
- Updated Channel Info Dialog to show several communities (in overflow menu if
  there is not enough space)
- More info updated when hovering over history graph in Channel Info Dialog
  (uptime, communities, stream type)

### Notifications
- Don't match own messages by default, but added option to do so anyway
- Added option to only trigger on messages containing bits
- Added text matching for Stream Status and Subscriber Notifications
- Added separate dialog to edit text matching pattern, including some basic help
- Prevent channel tab color changing from own messages (by username)

### TAB Completion
- Added settings to what TAB and Shift-TAB should complete, but always complete
  to username when using the @ prefix
- Added completion of Custom Command names
- Reorganized settings

### Custom Commands / Moderation
- Added $lower function to make text lowercase
- Improved error output, showing the place the error occured more conveniently
- Made function parsing more lenient, so that you can use a replacement in
  the first function parameter (if it starts with "$"), which usually would
  require an identifier (e.g. "$lower(1)" or "$lower($(1))")
- AutoMod: Made name of filtered messages in chat clickable, so you can open the
  context menu or User Info Dialog to approve/deny a message
- Added special commands /Automod_approve and /Automod_deny that can be used to
  position the Approve/Deny buttons in the User Info Dialog

### Other Settings Stuff
- Highlights/Ignore: Added "re*:" prefix (matching anywhere in message, except
  of whole message, so "re*:abc" and "re:.*abc.*" would be equivalent)
- Added "Test"-button to some matcher settings (e.g. Highlights) where you can
  test if the pattern you entered matches a text
- Added setting to close User Info Dialog when clicking on button (enabled by
  default to keep previous behaviour, but can be disabled now)
- Added ability to add Livestreamer fallback quality options
- Added "Edit all entries" button to some list settings, which allows all
  entries to be edited in one editbox (separated by newlines)

### Other Improvements
- Vodcasts are now marked with "[VOD]" in several places, and also made the
  Channel Info Dialog history graph line color grey for Vodcasts
- Set Admin/Followers Dialog to first joined channel, if already open
- Don't immediately remove streams from Live Streams Dialog on request error
- Added "/userinfo &lt;name&gt;" command to open specific User Info Dialog
- Live Streams List: Added hotkeys for join selected (Enter), open Channel Info
  (Space) and open context menu (Context Menu Button)
- Channel Info Dialog: Added ESC hotkey to close
- Removed message type from Tray Notifications, which should allow Chatty icon
  to show up on them on some OS
- Minor memory usage improvement in regards to Twitch Emotes metadata
- Show Twitch Charity messages
- Updated help

### Bugfixes
- Fixed error related to the User Dialog custom buttons setting
- Fixed error in Notification settings when no sounds could be found
- Fixed global emotes showing as Subscriber Emotes in context menu
- Fixed deselecting graph item on channel change
- Fixed Whisper-Type Notification triggering when it shouldn't
- Fixed parsing behaviour of numeric identifiers with more than one number
- Fixed minor display bug in Live Streams List
</pre>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="0.8.6">Version 0.8.6</a> (2017-05-27)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This version features a new Notification system, which combines both
        Desktop Notifications and Sounds. It is more flexible to configure and
        can be easier extended on the programming side. It has more types of
        events (like Whispers or AutoMod messages), better matching of events
        (matching text or restricting to a channel) and things like configurable
        colors for Desktop Notifications.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> While your previous Desktop Notification Settings should be
        carried over, you will have to reconfigure any Sounds in the new system
        (if you used any).</p>
    
<pre>
### General
- Added new Notification system
- Added support for new sub messages
- Added button to sort some setting lists alphabetically

### Bugfixes

- Added workaround for error occuring in Java 1.8.0_131 (the actual cause of the
  error is still unclear, but hopefully this works well enough)
</pre>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
<pre>
- Fixed Whispering that didn't work due to changed Twitch behaviour

  commands, to allow for some more usages

    </h2>
    <p>Custom Commands got a major overhaul in this version, which means that
        some of the Custom Commands you are using may have to be fixed (although
        it should be mostly backwards-compatible). Both Custom Commands and
        adding them to the Context Menus/User Dialog has become more flexible
        (for example you can add custom submenus, define commands directly in
        the menu and move/remove the Mod/Unmod button in the User Dialog). Check
        out the <a href="help-custom_commands.html">updated help</a> if you want
        to learn more about it.</p>
    
    <p>Also featured in this version is support for Communities in the Admin
        Dialog. As with games Communities can be favorited and are integrated
        into the Presets.</p>
    
<pre>

    </h2>
    <p>With the new experimental Message Spacing setting (<code>Settings - Main</code>)

        mods to see what commands other mods have executed in the channel. In
        Chatty you can view these mod actions in a separate window via

    <h2>
        <a name="0.8.3">Version 0.8.3</a> (2016-06-28)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Twitch has added information on the length of timeouts, which Chatty will
        now output by default behind deleted messages. Twitch Chat now also
        supports reason messages for timeouts/bans, which will be shown in
        Chatty only to the affected person as well as all mods.</p>
    
    <p>You can now follow people directly out of Chatty using the commands
        <code>/follow</code> and <code>/unfollow</code> and via context menus
        under <code>Miscellaneous</code>. If you try to follow someone you are
        already following, it will show how long you are already following.</p>
    
    <p><em>Important:</em> To be able to follow/unfollow channels you first need
        to request new login data, because this feature requires the
        <code>Follow channels</code> access which Chatty didn't request before.</p>
    
    <p>This version also adds initial support for the new re-sub notifications
        with attached messages.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>During March Twitch migrated Twitch Chat to new servers (Amazon AWS),
        which you probably noticed due to some issues for some third-party
        tools. This however also brought some improvements:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Twitch Chat now supports SSL on ports 6697 and 443
            <ul>
                <li>Chatty will automatically add these to the default ports if
                    your port setting is still on the previous default
                    (otherwise you might have to add them yourself).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>No separate Event Chat servers anymore
            <ul>
                <li>Access all channels, including of big events, in Chatty
                    without having to change servers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Whispers (and Group Chat) got moved to AWS early April
            <ul>
                <li>No Whisper server configuration required anymore, just
                    enable Whispers in the settings if you want to use them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

- Show correctly capitalized stream names in Live Streams/Channel Info Dialog
  (independent of the Correctly Capitalized Names setting)
- Added minimize to tray/close to tray options
- Added setting for auto scroll down timeout length
- Added setting to change font size of dialogs (experimental, only Userinfo now)
- Added setting to customize chat log file location

- Changed stream status writer to ignore case of stream name
- Channel Info: Added approx. last stream length as tooltip to "Offline" text
- Changed Twitch badges to use images instead of alpha (shows new colors now)
- Changed base colors for badges to new Twitch colors (affects FFZ Mod Icon and
  Fallback Icons)
- Allow for selection of text in chat by double-clicking (focus to inputbox now
  only on single-click on chat)
- Detect a few more URL formats to be made clickable
- Improved debug logging a bit (memory usage)
- Some small improvements to memory usage
- Added some more characters to Font Selection Dialog, but also an input field
  to enter your own text to test the font
- Catch the error if hotkey library couldn't be found and output warning instead
- Updated help

Bugfixes:
- Fixed info messages sometimes going to the wrong window if popouts are used
- Fixed subscriber sorting in userlist (but overall sorting can still be screwed
  up sometimes)
- Fixed wrong channel being joined when joining channel out of user context menu
  with "Capitalize Names (First Letter)" option being enabled (fixed implicitly
  by changing some stuff around for supporting capitalized names)
- Added workaround for Twitch emotes appearing wrong on Retina displays
- Nothing to do with Chatty in particular (it's the same for every IRC client),
  but the "xy just subscribed" message should now work for everyone again,
  because Twitch fixed it :)

    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The port setting has changed. If you have changed the port setting
        to another value before, it will be reverted to the new default with
        this update.</li>
        <li>With the introduction of group chat, Twitch apparently removed the
        "xy just subscribed" messages from the chat version Chatty uses. There
        was also a new version introduced that still has those messages and is
        generally better (association of bans/info messages/subscribers to
        channels), but it lacks joins/parts, which means no joins/parts can be
        shown and the userlist will only contain those people who have said
        something.<br />
        <br />
        If you don't care about showing joins/parts and you don't care about
        a correct/complete userlist, then it may be beneficial for you to
        enable the <code>Chat Client Version 3</code> option in the Settings
        Dialog under <code>Advanced</code>. <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-Other">More information..</a></li>

  association for bans/timeouts/subscribers and "xy just subscribed" message
- Added /slap command due to S'ome demand
- Improved connecting to chat (automatically trying different servers/ports)
- Added more shortcuts and stuff
- Added option to rejoin currently open channels when connecting

Changes:
- Moved Ignore joins/parts option to settings dialog
- Some small improvements
- Updated help

Bugfixes:
- Hopefully fixed synchronization error

    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
<h3>Import Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With Version 0.5, Chatty can notify you about streams you follow and
        show a list of them. You have to request
        new login data containing <code>&lt;Read user info&gt;</code> access to
        be able to use that. Go to 
        <code>&lt;Main - Connect - Configure login..&gt;</code>, remove the
        login and request it again.</li>
    <li>You can enable/disable this feature under
        <code>&lt;Main - Settings - Notifications&gt;</code> if you have the
        necessary access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Full Changelog</h3>
<pre>
New features:
- Get notified when streams you follow go online (requires
  &lt;Read user info&gt; access, which wasn't even in Chatty before, so you'll

- FrankerFaceZ emoticons
- Added search, allowing you to find text in the current chat window
- Deleted messages (from timeouts/bans) now get shortened to a maximum length,
  or you can use the previous behaviour or let the whole message be replaced
  with &lt;message deleted&gt;
- Change the displayed time range in Viewer History
- Automatically check if the login is valid, if it is suspected not to be
- Clickable links in Channel Info Dialog (also turns #srl-abcd into a race link)
- Cycle between tabs with Ctrl+TAB

Changes:
- Updated Help
- Changed Settings Dialog Layout
- Detect subscribers even when in more than one channel (may not work correctly
  always, but it's a better guess than before)

Bugfixes:
- Changed color of inputbox cursor to foreground color
- Possibly made emoticon image loading a bit more reliable, but it's hard to
  tell what happens when the loading fails
- Handle long URLs in the URL open dialog better
