    <h2>
        <a name="0.8.2">Version 0.8.2</a> <a name="latest">(This one!)</a> (2016-03-10)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>During March Twitch migrated Twitch Chat to new servers (Amazon AWS),
        which you probably noticed due to some issues for some third-party
        tools. This however also brought some improvements.</p>
    
        <p>Twitch Chat now supports SSL
        on ports 6697 and 443 and Chatty will automatically add these to the default ports if
        your port setting is still on the previous default (otherwise you might
        have to add it yourself). The migration also got rid of Event Chat which
        previously meant some big channels were on separate severs and not easily accesible from Chatty or
        Mobile Chat. Now all channels should be on the same servers.</p>
    <h3>Full Changelog</h3>

<pre>
Core Changes:

  enabled by default in Chatty (doesn't mean joins/parts have to be shown)
- Added experimental support for secured connections

Emoticons:
- Changed Emoticon parsing to use spaces as delimiter instead of word boundaries
  (to match changes made to Twitch Chat)
- Scaling: Added settings to scale emotes in chat and the Emotes Dialog

  in chat when a channel is still being hosted when the stream is going live
- Streamlined reconnection messages a bit
- Output message if channel attempting to join doesn't exist on Twitch
- Added correctly capitalized names from IRCv3 display-name tag, removed

  shows correctly if mode toggled while you are already in the channel, until

    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now add your favorite Twitch Emotes to the new <code>Favorites</code>
        page of the Emote Dialog. Right-click on the emote you want to add to

Bugfixes:
- Fixed info messages sometimes going to the wrong window if popouts are used
- Fixed subscriber sorting in userlist (but overall sorting can still be screwed
  up sometimes)
- Fixed wrong channel being joined when joining channel out of user context menu
  with "Capitalize Names (First Letter)" option being enabled (fixed implicitly
  by changing some stuff around for supporting capitalized names)
- Added workaround for Twitch emotes appearing wrong on Retina displays
- Nothing to do with Chatty in particular (it's the same for every IRC client),
  but the "xy just subscribed" message should now work for everyone again,
  because Twitch fixed it :)

    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Addressbook categories are now all lowercase. If you have any
        categories that only use case to differentiate between them, this might
        be a problem for you. Otherwise it should make things a bit clearer and
        easier.</li>

    <h3>Full Changelog</h3>
<pre>
New features:

    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The port setting has changed. If you have changed the port setting
        to another value before, it will be reverted to the new default with
        this update.</li>
        <li>With the introduction of group chat, Twitch apparently removed the
        "xy just subscribed" messages from the chat version Chatty uses. There
        was also a new version introduced that still has those messages and is
        generally better (association of bans/info messages/subscribers to
        channels), but it lacks joins/parts, which means no joins/parts can be
        shown and the userlist will only contain those people who have said
        something.<br />
        <br />
        If you don't care about showing joins/parts and you don't care about
        a correct/complete userlist, then it may be beneficial for you to
        enable the <code>Chat Client Version 3</code> option in the Settings
        Dialog under <code>Advanced</code>. <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-Other">More information..</a></li>

  association for bans/timeouts/subscribers and "xy just subscribed" message
- Added /slap command due to S'ome demand
- Improved connecting to chat (automatically trying different servers/ports)
- Added more shortcuts and stuff
- Added option to rejoin currently open channels when connecting

Changes:
- Moved Ignore joins/parts option to settings dialog
- Some small improvements
- Updated help

    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
<h3>Import Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With Version 0.5, Chatty can notify you about streams you follow and
        show a list of them. You have to request
        new login data containing <code>&lt;Read user info&gt;</code> access to
        be able to use that. Go to 
        <code>&lt;Main - Connect - Configure login..&gt;</code>, remove the
        login and request it again.</li>
    <li>You can enable/disable this feature under
        <code>&lt;Main - Settings - Notifications&gt;</code> if you have the
        necessary access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Full Changelog</h3>
<pre>
New features:
- Get notified when streams you follow go online (requires
  &lt;Read user info&gt; access, which wasn't even in Chatty before, so you'll
  have to request new login data)
- View a list of live streams (you followed or whose channel you are in)
- FrankerFaceZ emoticons
- Added search, allowing you to find text in the current chat window
- Deleted messages (from timeouts/bans) now get shortened to a maximum length,
  or you can use the previous behaviour or let the whole message be replaced
  with &lt;message deleted&gt;
- Change the displayed time range in Viewer History
- Automatically check if the login is valid, if it is suspected not to be
- Clickable links in Channel Info Dialog (also turns #srl-abcd into a race link)
- Cycle between tabs with Ctrl+TAB

Changes:
- Updated Help
- Changed Settings Dialog Layout
- Detect subscribers even when in more than one channel (may not work correctly
  always, but it's a better guess than before)

Bugfixes:
- Changed color of inputbox cursor to foreground color
- Possibly made emoticon image loading a bit more reliable, but it's hard to
  tell what happens when the loading fails
- Handle long URLs in the URL open dialog better
