    <h2>
        <a name="0.8.2">Version 0.8.2</a> <a name="latest">(This one!)</a> (2016-04-26)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>During March Twitch migrated Twitch Chat to new servers (Amazon AWS),
        which you probably noticed due to some issues for some third-party
        tools. This however also brought some improvements:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Twitch Chat now supports SSL on ports 6697 and 443
            <ul>
                <li>Chatty will automatically add these to the default ports if
                    your port setting is still on the previous default
                    (otherwise you might have to add them yourself).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>No separate Event Chat servers anymore
            <ul>
                <li>Access all channels, including of big events, in Chatty
                    without having to change servers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Whispers (and Group Chat) got moved to AWS early April
            <ul>
                <li>No Whisper server configuration required anymore, just
                    enable Whispers in the settings if you want to use them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

- Allow for selection of text in chat by double-clicking (focus to inputbox now
  only on single-click on chat)
- Detect a few more URL formats to be made clickable
- Improved debug logging a bit (memory usage)
- Some small improvements to memory usage
- Added some more characters to Font Selection Dialog, but also an input field
  to enter your own text to test the font
- Catch the error if hotkey library couldn't be found and output warning instead
- Updated help

Bugfixes:
- Fixed info messages sometimes going to the wrong window if popouts are used
- Fixed subscriber sorting in userlist (but overall sorting can still be screwed
  up sometimes)
- Fixed wrong channel being joined when joining channel out of user context menu
  with "Capitalize Names (First Letter)" option being enabled (fixed implicitly
  by changing some stuff around for supporting capitalized names)
- Added workaround for Twitch emotes appearing wrong on Retina displays
- Nothing to do with Chatty in particular (it's the same for every IRC client),
  but the "xy just subscribed" message should now work for everyone again,
  because Twitch fixed it :)

        <li><a href="help.html#followers">Followers and Subscribers</a> lists

    <p><em>Just a reminder:</em> If you don't care about a correct userlist or joins/parts,
        you may want to switch to Twitch Client Version 3 (<code>Settings - Advanced</code>),
        which has a few advantages.

    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The port setting has changed. If you have changed the port setting
        to another value before, it will be reverted to the new default with
        this update.</li>
        <li>With the introduction of group chat, Twitch apparently removed the
        "xy just subscribed" messages from the chat version Chatty uses. There
        was also a new version introduced that still has those messages and is
        generally better (association of bans/info messages/subscribers to
        channels), but it lacks joins/parts, which means no joins/parts can be
        shown and the userlist will only contain those people who have said
        something.<br />
        <br />
        If you don't care about showing joins/parts and you don't care about
        a correct/complete userlist, then it may be beneficial for you to
        enable the <code>Chat Client Version 3</code> option in the Settings
        Dialog under <code>Advanced</code>. <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-Other">More information..</a></li>

  association for bans/timeouts/subscribers and "xy just subscribed" message
- Added /slap command due to S'ome demand
- Improved connecting to chat (automatically trying different servers/ports)
- Added more shortcuts and stuff
- Added option to rejoin currently open channels when connecting

Changes:
- Moved Ignore joins/parts option to settings dialog
- Some small improvements
- Updated help

Bugfixes:
- Hopefully fixed synchronization error

<h2>
    <a name="0.5">Version 0.5</a> (2013-12-05)
    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
<h3>Import Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With Version 0.5, Chatty can notify you about streams you follow and
        show a list of them. You have to request
        new login data containing <code>&lt;Read user info&gt;</code> access to
        be able to use that. Go to 
        <code>&lt;Main - Connect - Configure login..&gt;</code>, remove the
        login and request it again.</li>
    <li>You can enable/disable this feature under
        <code>&lt;Main - Settings - Notifications&gt;</code> if you have the
        necessary access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Full Changelog</h3>
<pre>
New features:
- Get notified when streams you follow go online (requires
  &lt;Read user info&gt; access, which wasn't even in Chatty before, so you'll
  have to request new login data)

- FrankerFaceZ emoticons
- Added search, allowing you to find text in the current chat window
- Deleted messages (from timeouts/bans) now get shortened to a maximum length,
  or you can use the previous behaviour or let the whole message be replaced
  with &lt;message deleted&gt;
- Change the displayed time range in Viewer History
- Automatically check if the login is valid, if it is suspected not to be
- Clickable links in Channel Info Dialog (also turns #srl-abcd into a race link)
- Cycle between tabs with Ctrl+TAB

Changes:
- Updated Help
- Changed Settings Dialog Layout
- Detect subscribers even when in more than one channel (may not work correctly
  always, but it's a better guess than before)

Bugfixes:
- Changed color of inputbox cursor to foreground color
- Possibly made emoticon image loading a bit more reliable, but it's hard to
  tell what happens when the loading fails
- Handle long URLs in the URL open dialog better
