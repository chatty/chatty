    <p>Learn what directories and files Chatty creates/uses.</p>
    <h2><a name="directories">Directories</a></h2>
    <h3>Settings Directory</h3>
    <p>The settings directory by default is in your user home directory in a
        subfolder called <code>.chatty</code>. If you use the <code>-cd</code>
    commandline parameter, then the settings directory is the current Working
    Directory.</p>
    
    <p>You can use commandline parameters by creating a shortcut and setting the
        target to something like <code>javaw.exe -jar "D:\Chatty\Chatty.jar" -cd</code>.</p>
    <h3>Working Directory</h3>
    <p>This directory is associated with Chatty when you start it. This is usually
    the directory the program is started from. If you created a shortcut to start
    Chatty with, this may point to the Java-executable instead of Chatty itself,
    which can lead to errors. In Windows, you can change the Working Directory
    in the shortcut settings by changing what is defined under <code>Run in</code>.</p>
    <h3>JAR Location</h3>
    <p>This is where the Chatty.jar is located and is used for loading libraries
    that Chatty uses.</p>
    
    <h3>Displaying Directories in Chatty</h3>
    <p>You can use the <code>/dir</code> command in Chatty to output the settings
        directory and the <code>/wdir</code> command for the working directory
        (<code>/openDir</code> and <code>/openWdir</code> to open them in the standard filebrowser).
    You can also check the settings dialog for the directory where the logs
    are saved in and the directory where the sounds are loaded from.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="files">Files</a></h2>
    <h3>Write and read</h3>
    <p>There are several files that Chatty creates/changes when you run/close it.</p>
    <table class="files">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Location</th>

            <td>backup_&lt;number&gt;_&lt;orig_filename&gt;</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Read-only</h3>
    <p>Files that Chatty only reads but doesn't modify.</p>
    <table class="files">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Location</th>
            <th>Files</th>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>&lt;working&gt;/sounds</td>
            <td>.wav files</td>
            <td>Chatty loads the sounds from here</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Images</td>
            <td>&lt;working&gt;/img</td>
            <td>.png files</td>
            <td>Default location where images for custom usericons are loaded
            from</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>JIntellitype</td>
            <td>&lt;working&gt;</td>
            <td>JIntellitype.dll</td>
            <td>If you have a version of Chatty with Hotkey support</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2><a name="backup">Backup</a></h2>
    <p>Chatty performs an automatic backup (enabled by default) everytime it is
    started (if at least the number of days as defined in the settings have passed,
    by default one). It copies the setting files (except login) to the backup folder
    in the settings directory, increasing the numbering of the files with every
    backup. It only makes as many backups as defined in the settings and then
    starts over with the first number, rotating the files.</p>

    <p>This is supposed to make recovery of settings easier in case they are not
        read or written correctly and thus lost (which shouldn't usually
        happen). In that case you can manually copy/rename the lost files from
        a backup (just looks for the most recent one based on the change date
        that looks fine).</p>
    
    <p><em>If some settings are important to you this can help, but you
            shouldn't rely on it. Always make your own backups, best on a
            different device!</em></p>
