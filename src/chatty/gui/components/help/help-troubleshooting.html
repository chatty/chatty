    <h2>
        <a name="performance">Bad performance / OutOfMemoryError</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You may want to check if Irc logging is enabled in the Debug Window
        (<code>Extra - Debug window - Checkbox: Irc log</code>), which should
    be disabled by default, but can lower performance if checked.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="jintellitype">Global hotkeys don't work</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>First of all, you only need Global Hotkey support when you want to use
        global hotkeys (which you can define in the settings). If you don't, you
        can just ignore any related messages or download the version of Chatty
        without Hotkey support. Global hotkeys currently only work on Windows.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to use global hotkeys and you get a message related to them
        not working, check the following sections. If you don't get a message,
        but the global hotkeys you defined just don't work, make sure you
        actually have global hotkeys enabled in the settings.</p>
    
    <h3>Wrong version of Chatty</h3>
    <p>If you try to add a global hotkey and it tells you that you have the
        wrong version of Chatty, you probably don't have the version supporting
        global hotkeys. Download the version that contains <code>hotkey</code>
        in the <code>.zip</code> filename and try that instead.</p>
    
    <h3>Could not load library (jintellitype-1.3.8.jar)</h3>
    <p>Chatty requires the <code>jintellitype-1.3.8.jar</code> to be in the
        <code>lib</code> subfolder of where the <code>Chatty.jar</code> is
        located.</p>
        
    <h3>Could not load JIntellitype.dll</h3>
    <p>If you get this error, you started Chatty with Hotkey support, but it
    couldn't load the library (.dll) necessary to register hotkeys. This can
    mean that:
    
    <ul>
        <li>You have the wrong version for your version
            of Java (32bit or 64bit Java need different versions of the <code>.dll</code>)</li>
        <li>The <code>JIntellitype.dll</code> isn't stored where the program can
        find it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Find out if you have the 64bit or 32bit version of Java (e.g. by
        entering <code>java -version</code> on the commandline to check if there
        is 64bit in the response), then check if you downloaded the matching
        version of Chatty.</p>
    
    <p>Enter <code>/wdir</code> in Chatty to find out what your working directory
        is and make sure the <code>JIntellitype.dll</code> is in there. If you
        are starting Chatty via a shortcut, remember that the directory
        specified in the <code>Run in</code> field determines your working
        directory (on Windows at least, but global hotkeys are currently Windows only
        anyway).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Enter <code>/dir</code> in Chatty to find out what your settings
            directory is (<code>/openDir</code> to open it) and whether that's
            the one you used before (there should be quite a few files and
            folders).</li>

        <a name="login">Can't connect because the login failed</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you repeatedly get disconnected because of possibly invalid login
    data, please go to <code>Main - Login.. - Verify login</code>.
    This will send a request to Twitch to check if the access token is valid.
    If the login data is valid, then Twitch may just have temporary problems
    and you should try again later. The same goes for when the check itself
    fails because it can't reach the Twitch API.</p>
    <p>If the login data isn't valid, you can just remove the login and request
        new login data. Also see the <a href="help.html#login-invalid">section about login</a>
    for more information about invalid logins.</p>
    <p>Another reason may be that you are connecting to the <a href="#connect">wrong port</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="connect">Can't connect</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>It's possible that your internet/firewall doesn't like the port you are
        using to connect. By default it tries to connect to <code>6667</code>
        first. Twitch may also have changed the ports. You can check <a href="http://twitchstatus.com">Twitchstatus.com</a>
        (not an official Twitch site) which chat server/ports are available (make sure to use an <code>irc</code> server).
        The host <code>irc.twitch.tv</code> should resolve to the available server IPs, so you normally
        shouldn't have to enter an IP directly (for main chat).</p>
    
    <p>If you are using a shortcut to start Chatty, also check any
        custom server/port you may have defined there using <a href="help.html#launch">commandline parameters</a>.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="font">Broken characters / Fallback fonts</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If Java encounters a character that is not contained in the chat font
        you currently have configured, it will try to find it in the fallback
        fonts. You can add your own fallback fonts if you need to be able to
        display more characters than by default.</p>
    
    <p>The Java fallback font directory is located in the Java Runtime Environment
        (you may have to create the <code>/fallback</code> directory yourself):
        <code>&lt;JRE_DIR&gt;/lib/fonts/fallback</code></p>
    
    <p>To find the <code>&lt;JRE_DIR&gt;</code> location you can either enter
        the command <code>/openJavaDir</code> to open the directory in your file
        browser or enter the command <code>/showJavaDir</code> to output the
        path. The commands have to be entered in the Chatty chat inputbox.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> If you set the <code>inputFont</code>
        <a href="help-setting_commands.html#font">setting</a> to something other
        than a Java logical font (which is currently only possible through
        setting commands, changing through the Settings Dialog is fine), then
        the font fallback mechanism may break.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="start">Chatty won't start</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You need to have at least Java 8 JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed to run Chatty.</p>
    <p>If you try to start Chatty by double-clicking the <code>Chatty.jar</code>,
        first make sure that <code>.jar</code> files are associated with Java,
        and not some other program like WinRAR. The icon of the <code>Chatty.jar</code>
        should have a Java icon (coffee cup). If you right-click the <code>Chatty.jar</code>
        you can select the program to open it with under <code>Open with</code>.</p>
    
    <p>If you are sure that the <code>Chatty.jar</code> is actually started with
        Java, but no program window appears, it may be that an error occured before
    the window (GUI) could be created.</p>
    
    <h3>Run from commandline</h3>
    <p>Running Chatty from the commandline has the advantage of being able to
    get messages from before the GUI is established. It also may work when Java
    isn't integrated into the OS correctly (but is installed).</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Open a commandline window on the directory where the
            <code>Chatty.jar</code> is located
            <ul>
                <li>Windows: In the File Explorer, while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>
                    Right-Click on an empty space (without a file selected) of
                    the folder where the <code>Chatty.jar</code> is located.
                    Click on <code>Open command window here</code> in the
                    context menu.</li>
            </ul>
       </li>
       <li>In the commandline window, enter <code>java -jar Chatty.jar</code>
           and press Enter.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>When you enter the above command and Chatty starts correctly (but doesn't
        when you double-click the <code>Chatty.jar</code>), this may mean that
        Java isn't integrated into the OS properly. You can create a
        <a href="help-guide_create_shortcut.html">shortcut</a> or a .bat-file to
        start Chatty similiar to entering the command above, but much more
        conveniently.</p>
    
    <p>If Chatty doesn't start when you enter the above command, check the
        commandline window for error messages.
        <a href="help.html#contact">Send</a> a screenshot of the commandline
        window along with information on what other things you tried if you
        require further assistance with it.</p>

    <h3>Check Association of .jar with Java (Windows)</h3>
    <p>If the integration of Java into the OS may not be correct, and you want
        to try to fix it, you can try this.</p>
    
    <p>Open a commandline window and enter <code>assoc .jar</code> which should output
        <code>.jar=jarfile</code> and enter <code>ftype jarfile</code> which should
        output something like <code>"C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1" %*</code>
        (see also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10875839/jar-file-keeps-giving-me-could-not-find-the-main-class-program-will-exit">
            Could not find the main class. Program will exit.</a>)</p>
    

    
    <h3>Error: Java is not recognized as an internal or external command (Windows)</h3>
    <p>If you experience this when entering <code>java -jar Chatty.jar</code>
    in the commandline, then it probably can't find Java because it's not in the
    <code>PATH</code> environment variable (that defines where to look
    for programs of which only the filename has been entered, not the whole path).</p>
    <p>You can enter <code>PATH</code> in a commandline window to check what is
    in it. It should show a list of semicolon-separated directories, one of which
    should point to Java.</p>
    
    <h3>Find errors in debug.log</h3>
    <p>See next section. Of course you'll have to navigate to the folder
    manually.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Some people experience issues with stuff in Chatty not being drawn
        correctly (e.g. on top of eachother, areas not showing). This is probably
        a Java bug that is system-dependant in some way (possibly OS or graphics
        driver related, it's not really clear). There is no definite solution
        for this, but there are a few things you can try:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check if you have any programs running that may interfere, programs
            that have been known to be incompatible for some people:
            <ul>
                <li>MSI Afterburner: Add <code>javaw.exe</code> to an ignore
                list or disable on-screen display support if possible</li>
                <li>Raptr</li>
            </ul>
        <li>If you have more than one monitor, try the other monitor. Not sure
        why, but some people had it work better on another monitor.</li>
        <li>Make sure the <code>Settings - Other - Disable Direct3D</code>
            setting is checked. Maybe also try <code>Disable DirectDraw</code>,
            although it should be redundant.</li>
        <li>Add the <code>-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false</code> parameter when starting
            Chatty, which does the same as the <code>Disable Direct3D</code>
            setting, but adding it as a starting parameter seemed to work better
            for some people. To do this, <a href="help-guide_create_shortcut.html">create a shortcut</a>
            and add the parameter, similiar to this (obviously adjusting to your
            paths):
            <code>javaw -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false -jar "D:\Chatty\Chatty.jar"</code></li>
        <li>Try the Windows Standalone version of Chatty (if you're on Windows
            of course).</li>
    </ul>
