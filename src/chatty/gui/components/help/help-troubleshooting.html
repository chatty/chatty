    <h2>
        <a name="performance">Bad performance / OutOfMemoryError</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You may want to check if Irc logging is enabled in the Debug Window
        (<code>Extra - Debug window - Checkbox: Irc log</code>), which should
    be disabled by default, but can lower performance if checked.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="jintellitype">Global hotkeys don't work</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>First of all, you only need Global Hotkey support when you want to use
        global hotkeys (which you can define in the settings). If you don't, you
        can just ignore any related messages or download the version of Chatty
        without Hotkey support. Global hotkeys currently only work on Windows.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to use global hotkeys and you get a message related to them
        not working, check the following sections. If you don't get a message,
        but the global hotkeys you defined just don't work, make sure you
        actually have global hotkeys enabled in the settings.</p>
    
    <h3>Wrong version of Chatty</h3>
    <p>If you try to add a global hotkey and it tells you that you have the
        wrong version of Chatty, you probably don't have the version supporting
        global hotkeys. Download the version that contains <code>hotkey</code>
        in the <code>.zip</code> filename and try that instead.</p>
    
    <h3>Could not load library (jintellitype-1.3.8.jar)</h3>
    <p>Chatty requires the <code>jintellitype-1.3.8.jar</code> to be in the
        <code>lib</code> subfolder of where the <code>Chatty.jar</code> is
        located.</p>
        
    <h3>Could not load JIntellitype.dll</h3>
    <p>If you get this error, you started Chatty with Hotkey support, but it
    couldn't load the library (.dll) necessary to register hotkeys. This can
    mean that:
    
    <ul>
        <li>You have the wrong version for your version
            of Java (32bit or 64bit Java need different versions of the <code>.dll</code>)</li>
        <li>The <code>JIntellitype.dll</code> isn't stored where the program can
        find it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Find out if you have the 64bit or 32bit version of Java (e.g. by
        entering <code>java -version</code> on the commandline to check if there
        is 64bit in the response), then check if you downloaded the matching
        version of Chatty.</p>
    
    <p>Enter <code>/wdir</code> in Chatty to find out what your working directory
        is and make sure the <code>JIntellitype.dll</code> is in there. If you
        are starting Chatty via a shortcut, remember that the directory
        specified in the <code>Run in</code> field determines your working
        directory (on Windows at least, but global hotkeys are currently Windows only
        anyway).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Enter <code>/dir</code> in Chatty to find out what your settings
            directory is (<code>/openDir</code> to open it) and whether that's
            the one you used before (there should be quite a few files and
            folders).</li>

        <a name="login">Can't connect because the login failed</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you repeatedly get disconnected because of possibly invalid login
    data, please go to <code>Main - Login.. - Verify login</code>.
    This will send a request to Twitch to check if the access token is valid.
    If the login data is valid, then Twitch may just have temporary problems
    and you should try again later. The same goes for when the check itself
    fails because it can't reach the Twitch API.</p>
    <p>If the login data isn't valid, you can just remove the login and request
        new login data. Also see the <a href="help.html#login-invalid">section about login</a>
    for more information about invalid logins.</p>
    <p>Another reason may be that you are connecting to the <a href="#connect">wrong port</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="connect">Can't connect</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>It's possible that your internet/firewall doesn't like the port you are
        using to connect. By default it tries to connect to <code>6667</code>
        first. Twitch may also have changed the ports. You can check <a href="http://twitchstatus.com">Twitchstatus.com</a>
        (not an official Twitch site) which chat server/ports are available (make sure to use an <code>irc</code> server).
        The host <code>irc.twitch.tv</code> should resolve to the available server IPs, so you normally
        shouldn't have to enter an IP directly (for main chat).</p>
    
    <p>If you are using a shortcut to start Chatty, also check any
        custom server/port you may have defined there using <a href="help.html#launch">commandline parameters</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="font">Some characters in chat only show up as boxes / Fallback fonts</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If Java encounters a character that is not contained in the chat font
        you currently have configured, it will try to find it in the fallback
        fonts. While still not all characters will be displayed this way, it
        should work a lot better. If you want to be able to display even more
        characters, you can add your own fallback fonts into the Java fallback
        font directory: <code>&lt;JRE_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/jre/lib/fonts/fallback</code></p>
    
    <p>On Windows, the JRE would usually be located in
        <code>C:\Program Files\Java\</code> or
        <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\</code>.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> If you set the <code>inputFont</code>
        <a href="help-setting_commands.html#font">setting</a> to something else
        besides a Java logical font, then the font fallback mechanism may break.
        This was the case before version 0.7.3.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="start">Chatty won't start</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You need to have at least Java 7 JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed to run Chatty.</p>
    <p>If you try to start Chatty by double-clicking the <code>Chatty.jar</code>,
        first make sure that <code>.jar</code> files are associated with Java,
        and not some other program like WinRAR. The icon of the <code>Chatty.jar</code>
        should have a Java icon (coffee cup). If you right-click the <code>Chatty.jar</code>
        you can select the program to open it with under <code>Open with</code>.</p>
    
    <p>If you are sure that the <code>Chatty.jar</code> is actually started with
        Java, but no program window appears, it may be that an error occured before
    the window (GUI) could be created.</p>
    
    <h3>Run from commandline</h3>
    <p>Running Chatty from the commandline has the advantage of being able to
    get messages from before the GUI is established. It also may work when Java
    isn't integrated into the OS correctly (but is installed).</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Open a commandline window on the directory where the
            <code>Chatty.jar</code> is located
            <ul>
                <li>Windows: In the File Explorer, while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>
                    Right-Click into the folder where the
                    <code>Chatty.jar</code> is located. Click on <code>Open
                    command window here</code> in the context menu.</li>
            </ul>
       </li>
       <li>In the commandline window, enter <code>java -jar Chatty.jar</code>
           and press Enter.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>When you enter the above command and Chatty starts correctly (but doesn't
        when you double-click the <code>Chatty.jar</code>), this may mean that
        Java isn't integrated into the OS properly. You can create a
        <a href="help-guide_create_shortcut.html">shortcut</a> or a .bat-file to
        start Chatty similiar to entering the command above, but much more
        conveniently.</p>
    
    <p>If Chatty doesn't start when you enter the above command, check the
        commandline window for error messages.
        <a href="help.html#contact">Send</a> a screenshot of the commandline
        window along with information on what other things you tried if you
        require further assistance with it.</p>

    <h3>Check Association of .jar with Java (Windows)</h3>
    <p>If the integration of Java into the OS may not be correct, and you want
        to try to fix it, you can try this.</p>
    
    <p>Open a commandline window and enter <code>assoc .jar</code> which should output
        <code>.jar=jarfile</code> and enter <code>ftype jarfile</code> which should
        output something like <code>"C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1" %*</code>
        (see also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10875839/jar-file-keeps-giving-me-could-not-find-the-main-class-program-will-exit">
            Could not find the main class. Program will exit.</a>)</p>
    

    
    <h3>Error: Java is not recognized as an internal or external command (Windows)</h3>
    <p>If you experience this when entering <code>java -jar Chatty.jar</code>
    in the commandline, then it probably can't find Java because it's not in the
    <code>PATH</code> environment variable (that defines where to look
    for programs of which only the filename has been entered, not the whole path).</p>
    <p>You can enter <code>PATH</code> in a commandline window to check what is
    in it. It should show a list of semicolon-seperated directories, one of which
    should point to Java.</p>
    
    <h3>Find errors in debug.log</h3>
    <p>See next section. Of course you'll have to navigate to the folder
    manually.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you experience issues with the GUI where things are drawn on top of
        eachother or repeating themselves, try the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check if you have any programs running that may interfere, for
            example MSI Afterburner and add <code>javaw.exe</code> to an ignore
            list or disable on-screen display support if possible.</li>
        <li>If you have more than one monitor, try the other monitor. Not sure
        why, but some people had it work better on another monitor.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="log">Debug log</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you experience any problems or errors, then there may be helpful
    information for debugging in the debug log, which is located in the settings
    directory:</p>
    <p style="margin-left:10px"><code>&lt;user_dir&gt;/.chatty/debuglogs/</code>
        (Example: <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.chatty\debuglogs\</code>)</p>
    
    <p>If you have Chatty running you can enter <code>/openDir</code> to open it
        or <code>/dir</code> to output the path, then simply navigate to the
        <code>debuglogs</code> subfolder.</p>
    
    <p>In that folder, there are two kinds of debug files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>debug.log</code> which is overwritten everytime you start
            Chatty. It may also have a number at the end (like <code>debug.log.1</code>)
            if Java couldn't open the usual <code>debug.log</code>.</li>
        <li>Several files (<code>debug0.log, debug1.log, ..</code>), whereas
        one of them is written to at a time, and then switched to the next when
        a certain filesize is reached, rotating between a certain number of files.
        Those files are not overwritten when Chatty is started, but instead new data is appended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So to find possibly relevant data:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you haven't started Chatty again after the error occured, check
            the <code>debug.log</code> first.</li>
        <li>Otherwise check if one of the <code>debug0.log, debug1.log, ..</code>
            files could contain the necessary information, based on the last
        modification dates.
        <ul>
            <li>Even if the error is already some time back, it <em>may</em> still
            be in there, depending on how much data has been added in the meantime.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol>
