    <h1><a name="top">Admin Dialog</a></h1>
    <p>
        <a href="#status">Change game/title</a> | 
        <a href="#commercials">Run commercials</a>
    </p>

    <p><em>Open the Admin Dialog via <code>View - Channel Admin</code> or by
            right-clicking on the channel to open the context menu and choose
            <code>Channel Admin</code>.</em></p>
    
    <p>In the Admin Dialog you can edit your title/game and run commercials, if
        you have allowed Chatty access (you need <code>Editor Access</code>/
        <code>Commercial access</code> respectively, see <a href="help.html#access">allow more access</a>).</p>
    
    <p>The Admin Dialog is always opened for the currently active channel,
    unless there is no channel open (which is the case just after you started Chatty),
    in which case it will open for your own channel (you login with).</p>
    
    <h2><a name="status">Change game/title</a></h2>
    <p>The Status-Tab lets you view and change the title and game of your channel.
    The information is loaded when you open the dialog and when you press the
    <code>reload</code>-Button. If others may have changed the info in the meantime,
    you may want to reload before trying to change it.</p>
    
    <h3>Select a game</h3>
    <p>Use <code>Select game</code> to open a dialog where you can search for
        a game and also add games to the favorites.</p>
    
    <h3>Select communities</h3>
    <p>Communities in Twitch are an additional category you can select for your
        stream. If you want to use a Community, you need to select an already
        existing one. As with games, you can add favorite Communities. Make sure
        to adhere to the rules when selecting a Community for your stream.</p>
    
    <h3>Presets</h3>
    <p>Status Presets allow you to store the current title, game and communities
        for later use. A status is automatically added every time you press the
        <code>Update</code> button (can be disabled in the History settings),
        but will be removed after some time of not being used. You can also add
        the current status to the favorites by pressing the <code>Fav</code>
        button, which means it is never automatically removed from the Status
        Presets.</p>
    
    <p>Press the <code>Presets</code> button to open the Presets, where you can
        select a status (double-click to immediately use it) and filter by
        current game or favorites.</p>
    
    <p>The <code>Last Activity</code> column shows when this status was last
        set using the <code>Update</code> button (or when it was added to the
        favorites for the first time). The <code>Usage</code> column shows how
        often it was set using the <code>Update</code> button.</p>

    <h2><a name="commercials">Run commercials</a></h2>
    <p>If you are partnered with Twitch, you can run commercials on your channel
    here (even if you are not partnered it may run a commercial). Click on the
    appropriate button to try to run a commercial of the given length.</p>
    
    <p>The <code>Last run</code> time shows when a commercial was last run
    through Chatty (this session).</p>
    
    <h3>Schedule commercials</h3>
    <p>There are two different ways of scheduling a commercial, either running
    a single commerical on a delay or repeating running a commercial on a delay.
    Select either or both options and then press a <code>Run commercial</code>
    button to schedule the commercial. Press the same button again to cancel the
    scheduled commercial. Click a button of another length to change the length
    of the commercial while keeping it on schedule. Scheduled commercials are
    not completely exact, they may be run a few sceonds too late.</p>
    
    <p>If you have <code>Use delay</code> selected, then the commercial will be
        scheduled to run after the specified time. If you have <code>Repeat</code> selected,
    then - after each commercial run through Chatty - another commercial will automatically be scheduled to run again with the same delay.
    You don't need to have <code>Use delay</code> selected for <code>Repeat</code>
    to work, they just both use the same time as delay.</p>
    
    <p>The time for the delay will be interpreted as seconds by default, but you
    can also specify minutes. Examples: <code>30</code> (30 seconds), <code>5m</code>
    (5 minutes), <code>120s</code> (2 minutes).</p>
    
    <h3>Run commercials via global hotkey</h3>
    <p>If you have downloaded the appropriate version of Chatty (the one with
    "hotkey" in the .zip filename, Windows only), you can define a global hotkey
    to run 30s commercials on the channel you currently have open. The hotkey
    can be defined on the <code>Commercials</code> tab in the Admin Dialog
    (don't forget to press <code>Set</code> to actually set it).</p>
    
    <p>If you have the Admin Dialog open on the <code>Commercials</code> tab,
    then executing the hotkey will simulate a click on the 30s button, with all
    the implications like being able to use a delay, running the commercial on
    the channel that the Admin Dialog was opened on (instead of the currently
    active channel) and so on.</p>
