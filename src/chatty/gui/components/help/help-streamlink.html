    <p><a href="https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink">Streamlink</a>
    is a commandline program that can be used to watch streams in a player like
    VLC Player. It has to be downloaded and installed separately from Chatty.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    <p>You can open the Streamlink dialog that Chatty provides via 
    <code>Extra - Streamlink</code>, where you can directly run Streamlink
    and change some settings.</p>
    
    <p>Each time you open a stream via the dialog or a context menu, a tab is
    added to the dialog where the output of the Streamlink process is
    redirected to. If you open a stream with the same stream name and quality you already
    have open in a tab whose process isn't currently running, then that tab will
    be reused.</p>

    <p>The tab of a stream is automatically closed when you close the Video
    Player opened by Streamlink, if the dialog isn't currently open. Otherwise
    you have to close it yourself by using the <code>Close</code>-button on the
    top right, which turns into an <code>End process</code>-button as long as
    the process is still running. The <code>Retry</code>-button can be used to
    re-run the last command of that tab (for example when it couldn't find the
    stream, but you want to retry now because you know it's come online).</p>
    
    <h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
    <p>The settings can be changed in the Streamlink dialog.</p>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Enable context menu entry</dt>
        <dd>Adds a Streamlink submenu to all context menus that can be used to
            open streams (for example right-click on channel, username or Live
            Streams dialog).</dd>
        
        <dt>Show dialog when opening stream</dt>
        <dd>Auto-opens the Streamlink Dialog when you open a stream out of a
            context menu.</dd>
        
        <dt>Auto close dialog when starting player</dt>
        <dd>Auto-closes the Streamlink Dialog when the text <code>Starting player</code>
            comes up in the log.</dd>
        
        <dt>Context menu qualities</dt>
        <dd>You can customize which quality options appear in the context menu.
            The options you enter here are directly given as a parameter to
            Streamlink, except <code>Select</code> which tells Chatty you want
            to select a quality in the dialog.</dd>
        <dd>Separate qualities by space or comma, add a <code>|</code> (vertical
            bar) to add a separator to the menu.</dd>
        <dd>Enclose qualities in brackets <code>{ }</code> if you need to add
            commas, for example if you want to specify a list of fallback qualities.</dd>
        <dd>Optionally add a display name for a group of qualities by separating
            it with a colon (<code>:</code>).</dd>
        <dd><em>Examples:</em>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Best, High, Worst | Select</code></li>
                <li><code>Source High Medium Low Mobile | Select</code></li>
                <li><code>Best, {720p,720p60}, Select, {Audio,audio_only}</code></li>
                <li><code>{High Quality:1080p60,1080p,720p60,720p} {Low Quality:360p,240p}</code></li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Base command (Streamlink path and parameters)</dt>
        <dd>This must contain the Streamlink executable, including any
            commandline options that you always want to be included when running
            Streamlink out of Chatty.</dd>
        <dd>The URL and quality are automatically appended to this when running
            Streamlink, so the overall command that is executed is build like
            this:
            <code>&lt;Base&nbsp;command&gt; &lt;url&gt;&nbsp;&lt;quality&gt;</code>.</dd>
        <dd>You can use the variables <code>$stream</code>, <code>$url</code>
            and <code>$quality</code> in this setting (see Examples).</dd>
        <dd>The default is just <code>streamlink</code>, which is sufficient
            if Streamlink is correctly included in the systems PATH variable,
            but you may also specify the full path.</dd>
        <dd>Remember to surround the path or any parameters with quotes if they
            contain spaces, so the commandline knows they belong together.</dd>
        <dd><em>Examples:</em>
            <ul class="example-list">
                <li><code>"C:\My&nbsp;Programs\Streamlink\bin\streamlink.exe"</code><br />
                    (specify full path to the Streamlink executable)</li>
                <li><code>"C:\My Programs\Streamlink\bin\streamlink.exe" --player "C:\Program Files\MPC-HC\mpc-hc64.exe"</code><br />
                    (specify full path to Streamlink and use a different player)</li>
                <li><code>/usr/local/bin/streamlink</code><br />
                    (this might work on Linux/Mac if it can't find Streamlink
                    without the full path)</li>
                <li><code>streamlink -p "C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe --meta-title $stream/$quality"</code><br />
                    (change VLC Player window title to something more descriptive)</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Use Authorization (Twitch Oauth Token)</dt>
        <dd>Tell Streamlink to authenticate at Twitch with your Chatty access
            token.</dd>
        <dd>Enabling this may help if you get an error when running Streamlink
            (Bad Request).</dd>
        <dd>This is necessary for sub-only streams.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Can't run Streamlink</h3>
    <p>If you get an error like <code>Error: java.io.IOException: Cannot run
            program "&lt;...&gt;": CreateProcess error=2 [..]</code>, then
    Chatty probably can't find Streamlink on your system.</p>
    
    <p>To solve this, first make sure that
    you actually have Streamlink installed. You need to install it on you own, it does
    not come bundled with Chatty. If you are sure it is installed (and you maybe can
    run it from the commandline just fine), you may have to tell Chatty the full
    path to the Streamlink executable for it to work by entering it in the
    <code>Base command</code> field. See the <a href="#settings">Settings section</a> above for examples
    and help on that.</p>
