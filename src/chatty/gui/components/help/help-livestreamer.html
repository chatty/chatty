    <p><a href="https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer">Livestreamer</a>
    is a commandline program that can be used to watch streams in a player like
    VLC Player. It has to be downloaded and installed separately from Chatty.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Since Livestreamer doesn't appear to be developed anymore, there is an
        updated fork called <a href="https://streamlink.github.io/">Streamlink</a>, which works the same way. If you want to
        use Streamlink with Chatty, simply change the <code>Base command</code>
        to <code>streamlink</code> (or, as with Livestreamer, put the whole path to the program
        if that is required in your case). Currently Streamlink appears to be using the
        same commandline interface, so everything should work as usual (after
        changing the <code>Base command</code>). If they do change the
        interface, changes in Chatty may be required.</p>

    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    <p>You can open the Livestreamer dialog that Chatty provides via 
    <code>Extra - Livestreamer</code>, where you can directly run Livestreamer
    and change some settings.</p>
    
    <p>Each time you open a stream via the dialog or a context menu, a tab is
    added to the dialog where the output of the Livestreamer process is
    redirected to. If you open a stream with the same stream name and quality you already
    have open in a tab whose process isn't currently running, then that tab will
    be reused.</p>

    <p>The tab of a stream is automatically closed when you close the Video
    Player opened by Livestreamer, if the dialog isn't currently open. Otherwise
    you have to close it yourself by using the <code>Close</code>-button on the
    top right, which turns into an <code>End process</code>-button as long as
    the process is still running. The <code>Retry</code>-button can be used to
    re-run the last command of that tab (for example when it couldn't find the
    stream, but you want to retry now because you know it's come online).</p>
    
    <h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
    <p>The settings can be changed in the Livestreamer dialog.</p>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Enable context menu entry</dt>
        <dd>Adds a Livestreamer submenu to all context menus that can be used to
            open streams (for example right-click on channel, username or Live
            Streams dialog).</dd>
        
        <dt>Show dialog when opening stream</dt>
        <dd>Auto-opens the Livestreamer Dialog when you open a stream out of a
            context menu.</dd>
        
        <dt>Context menu qualities</dt>
        <dd>You can customize which quality options appear in the context menu.
            The options you enter here are directly given as a parameter to
            Livestreamer, except <code>Select</code> which tells Chatty you want
            to select a quality in the dialog.</dd>
        <dd>Separate qualities by space or comma, add a <code>|</code> (vertical
            bar) to add a separator to the menu.</dd>
        <dd>Enclose qualities in brackets <code>{ }</code> if you need to add
            commas, for example if you want to specify a list of fallback qualities.</dd>
        <dd>Optionally add a display name for a group of qualities by separating
            it with a colon (<code>:</code>).</dd>
        <dd><em>Examples:</em>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Best, High, Worst | Select</code></li>
                <li><code>Source High Medium Low Mobile | Select</code></li>
                <li><code>Best, {720p,720p60}, Select, {Audio,audio_only}</code></li>
                <li><code>{High Quality:1080p60,1080p,720p60,720p} {Low Quality:360p,240p}</code></li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Base command (Livestreamer path and parameters)</dt>
        <dd>This must contain the Livestreamer executable, including any
            commandline options that you always want to be included when running
            Livestreamer out of Chatty.</dd>
        <dd>The URL and quality are automatically appended to this when running
            Livestreamer, so the overall command that is executed is build like
            this:
            <code>&lt;Base&nbsp;command&gt; &lt;url&gt;&nbsp;&lt;quality&gt;</code>.</dd>
        <dd>You can use the variables <code>$stream</code>, <code>$url</code>
            and <code>$quality</code> in this setting (see Examples).</dd>
        <dd>The default is just <code>livestreamer</code>, which is sufficient
            if Livestreamer is correctly included in the systems PATH variable,
            but you may also specify the full path.</dd>
        <dd>Remember to surround the path or any parameters with quotes if they
            contain spaces, so the commandline knows they belong together.</dd>
        <dd><em>Examples:</em>
            <ul class="example-list">
                <li><code>"C:\My&nbsp;Programs\Livestreamer\livestreamer.exe"</code><br />
                    (specify full path to the Livestreamer executable)</li>
                <li><code>"C:\My Programs\Livestreamer\livestreamer.exe" --player "C:\Program Files\MPC-HC\mpc-hc64.exe"</code><br />
                    (specify full path to Livestreamer and use a different player)</li>
                <li><code>/usr/local/bin/livestreamer</code><br />
                    (this might work on Linux/Mac if it can't find Livestreamer
                    without the full path)</li>
                <li><code>livestreamer -p "C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe --meta-title $stream/$quality"</code><br />
                    (change VLC Player window title to something more descriptive)</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Use Authorization (Twitch Oauth Token)</dt>
        <dd>Tell Livestreamer to authenticate at Twitch with your Chatty access
            token.</dd>
        <dd>Enabling this may help if you get an error when running Livestreamer
            (Bad Request).</dd>
        <dd>This is necessary for sub-only streams.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
    <h3>Bad Request</h3>
    <p>Recently Twitch changed their API to require a Client ID being supplied,
        which Livestreamer doesn't do by default, so you may get a Bad Request
        error. You can fix this either by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enabling the <code>Use Authorization</code> setting to authenticate
            with Twitch, which makes the Twitch API derive the Client ID from
            the access token.</li>
        <li>Adding a Client ID to the <code>Base command</code>, for eaxmple to
            add Livestreamer's Client ID:<br />
            <code>livestreamer --http-header Client-ID=ewvlchtxgqq88ru9gmfp1gmyt6h2b93</code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're using Streamlink this shouldn't be an issue for you since it
        has been updated accordingly.</p>
    
    <h3>Can't run Livestreamer</h3>
    <p>If you get an error like <code>Error: java.io.IOException: Cannot run
            program "&lt;...&gt;": CreateProcess error=2 [..]</code>, then
    Chatty probably can't find Livestreamer on your system.</p>
    
    <p>To solve this, first make sure that
    you actually have Livestreamer installed. You need to install it on you own, it does
    not come bundled with Chatty. If you are sure it is installed (and you maybe can
    run it from the commandline just fine), you may have to tell Chatty the full
    path to the Livestreamer executable for it to work by entering it in the
    <code>Base command</code> field. See the <a href="#settings">Settings section</a> above for examples
    and help on that.</p>
