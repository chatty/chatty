    <p>This page details some of the settings in the Settings Dialog
        (<code>Main Menu - Settings</code>). Also try hovering over settings
    in the settings dialog itself, sometimes you can get a tooltip with some
    additional information. You can open this help in the settings dialog by
    clicking on the "Help" link on the bottom left.</p>

    <h3>Chat Font</h3>
    <p>Change font and font size by clicking on <code>Select font</code>.</p>
    
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Line Spacing</dt>
        <dd>Space between lines in the chat window. One message can consist of
            several lines. Lines that contain emotes may have a larger height.</dd>
        
        <dt>Message Spacing</dt>
        <dd>Space between messages. One message can consist of several lines,
            but this setting is only applied per message and doesn't affect the
            indiviual line height.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Input/Userlist Font</h3>
    <p>Input font is restricted to two fonts by default, because other fonts
        cause issues due to a bug in Java. The number behind the font is the
        font size. You can manually change this setting via
        <a href="help-setting_commands.html">Setting Commands</a> (as with most
        settings) if you really need another font, but pay attention to the
        <a href="help-setting_commands.html#font">note</a> about the adverse
        effects it may have.</p>
    
    <h3>Startup</h3>
    <p>You can select what will happen when you start Chatty:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Do nothing</strong> - Just do nothing special</li>
        <li><strong>Open connect dialog</strong> - Open dialog to connect</li>
        <li><strong>Connect and join specified channels</strong> - Connect
        immediately and join the channels specified in the field below. You can
        define several channels by seperating them with a comma.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect and join previously open channels</strong> - Connect
        immediately and join the channels you had open when you closed Chatty.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect and join favorited channels</strong> - Connect
        immediately and join the channels that are favorited in the Channel
        Favorites/History dialog.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Look&amp;Feel</h3>
    <p>The Look&amp;Feel changes the overall look of the program. The "System"
        Look&amp;Feel depends on the system you are on, the others are
        cross-platform. Some Look&amp;Feels also allow you to additionally
        select a different font size, which affects most of Chatty.</p>

    <h3>Deleted Messages (Timeouts/Bans)</h3>
    <p><em>Tip:</em> Click on a username in chat to open the User Info Dialog,
        which also shows the timeouts/bans and the original messages.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to handle deleted messages (timeouts/bans) in chat window:
            <dl class="dl-settings">
                <dt>Delete Message</dt>
                <dd>Completely replaces the message with <code>&lt;message deleted&gt;</code>.</dd>
                
                <dt>Strike through</dt>
                <dd>Keeps the whole message displayed, but crossed out.</dd>
                
                <dt>Strike through, shorten</dt>
                <dd>Crosses out the message but also shortens the message to the
                    given number of characters, so long spam messages don't take
                    up much space, but you can still kind of tell what they were
                    about.</dd>
                <dd>Shortened messages are indicated by the points at the end
                    that are <em>not</em> crossed out:
                    <code><span style="text-decoration: line-through">[12:30] Spammer: Deleted spam message Long copy pas</span>..</code></dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>Ban duration/reason:
            <dl class="dl-settings">
                <dt>Show ban duration</dt>
                <dd>Appends the length of timeouts in seconds (s) or minutes (m)
                    and "banned" for bans to the most recent message of the
                    banned user.</dd>
                <dd><code><span style="text-decoration: line-through">[23:12] Spammer: spam message</span> (10m)</code></dd>
                <dd><code><span style="text-decoration: line-through">[23:12] Spammer: spam message</span> (banned)</code> (permanent ban)</dd>
                <dd>If more than one timeout is issued, the appended info will update
                    with the length of the latest timeout, again always applied to the most recent
                    message of that user.</dd>
                <dd>Timeouts that happen more than a minute after the
                    offending message was originally received will cause the
                    appended info to include an asterisk at the end (*).</dd>
                <dd><code><span style="text-decoration: line-through">[23:12] Spammer: spam message</span> (10m)*</code></dd>
            
                <dt>Show ban reason (mod only)</dt>
                <dd>Show the reason for the timeout (if the mod has given one),
                    appended and updated together with the duration.</dd>
                <dd><code><span style="text-decoration: line-through">[23:12] Spammer: spam message</span> (banned) [rude tbh]</code></dd>
                <dd><code><span style="text-decoration: line-through">[23:12] Spammer: spam message</span> (10m) [emote spam]</code></dd>
                <dd>This is only available for mods of the channel as well as for
                    the user that was banned/timed out.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>In addition to handling the deleted message, Chatty can also show a
            separate message with info about the ban:
            <dl class="dl-settings">
                <dt>Show separate ban messages</dt>
                <dd>Enable separate ban/timeout info messages.</dd>
                <dd><code>&lt;name&gt; has been timed out</code></dd>
                <dd><code>&lt;name&gt; has been banned</code> (permanent ban)</dd>
            
                <dt>Combine ban messages</dt>
                <dd>Chatty can combine ban messages, which means if several
                    similiar bans/timeouts are issued for the same user within
                    10 seconds, only one message is shown, with the number of
                    included bans shown after the message, e.g.
                    <code>&lt;name&gt; has been timed out (3)</code>.</dd>
                <dd>Ban messages are not combined if a new message from the banned user was
                    received in the meantime.</dd>
                <dd>This is particularly useful when moderation bots want to
                    more reliably remove a message and issue several identical
                    timeouts a few seconds apart.</dd>
                
                <dt>Show ban duration</dt>
                <dd>Appends the length of timeouts in seconds (s) or minutes (m)
                    to the separate timeout info message.</dd>
                <dd><code>&lt;name&gt; has been timed out (60s)</code></dd>
            
                <dt>Show ban reason (mod only)</dt>
                <dd>Appends the reason for the timeout/ban (if the mod has given

                <dd><code>&lt;name&gt; has been timed out (600s) [emote spam]</code>
                <dd>This is only available for mods of the channel as well as for
                    the user that was banned/timed out.</dd>

            not only when someone was modded/unmodded but also when a mod joins
            or leaves the chat. This is not very reliable, since Twitch Chat
            sometimes sends a lot of MOD/UNMOD events, even if the mod never
            left the channel. See the <a href="help.html#userlist">Userlist</a>

        <dd>Replaces certain ranges of
        Unicode characters. Those characters are used in some
        languages to combine characters, but can apparently cause errors in some

        in the User Info Dialog (but not e.g. the chatlog written to file).

    <h3>Chat Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scroll down after <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> seconds of inactivity</strong>: If you scrolled
            up in chat but haven't moved scrollposition in the given number of seconds, it will scroll down
            if new messages come in. This prevents new messages from being hidden
            indefinitely if you accidently stayed scrolled up.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat buffer size</strong>: How many lines of text are kept
            for each channel in chat to scroll back to.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Pause Chat</h3>
    <p>The Pause Chat feature stops Chatty from scrolling down when you move the
        mouse over chat. This can be useful if you want to click specific stuff
        in a fast moving chat, for example if you are moderating or just want to
        click on an emote to see what it is.</p>
    
    <p><em>Please note:</em> This will not work properly until the chat window is filled with
        text, because only then will Chatty actively scroll down. Also, this
        only stops Chatty from actively scrolling down, so if e.g. a big message
        is being timed out and thus shortened, stuff may still move around accordingly
        (which in that case couldn't really be prevented anyway).</p>
    
    <p>Chat is paused as long as you move the mouse over chat or if you hold
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (and initiated pausing by moving the mouse). A little
        popup in the top-right will indicate that the chat is paused.</p>
    
    <p>Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> basicially acts as if you moved the mouse
        continuously.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pause chat when moving the mouse over it:</strong> Enables
        this feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Require Ctrl being pressed to start pausing chat:</strong>
            If this is enabled, you need to have <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> pressed to
            start pausing chat when moving the mouse over it. Once it's paused,
            you can let go of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and it will stay paused as long as
            you move the mouse (or hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> again to keep it paused
            even when not moving the mouse, as usual).</li>
        <li><strong>Run command when clicking on user (holding Ctrl):</strong>
            When you select a command here, then clicking on a user in chat
            while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> will run the command on that user. You
            can <a href="help-setting_commands.html#chat">manually edit</a> this
            setting to use another command.</li>

    <h3>Ignored Emotes</h3>
    <p>Emotes added to this list will not be turned into an image, but instead
        are just shown as their emote code.</p>
    <p>The code added to the list has to be the
    exact code used internally to find the emote in the messages. Usually this is simply
    the emote code as you would type it in chat, but some emotes have a special syntax
    that you might not even know (e.g. <code>:)</code> has <code>\:-?\)</code> as actual code).
    It is recommended to use the emote context menu (right-click on an emote in chat) to
    ignore emotes, because then the correct code will automatically be added to
    the list.</p>

    <h3>Usericon Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Show Usericons</strong>: Shows badges as images instead of
        just text</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Custom Usericons</strong>: Use the custom icons
        defined in the table below</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Bot Badge</strong>: Enables showing of the bot badge
        for known bots. Chatty shows a single bot badge for all known bots. The
        list of bot names comes from different sources: The <code>botNames</code>
        setting, the BTTV API and the FFZ API.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BTTV</strong>: Use botnames from the BTTV API</li>
            <li><strong>FFZ</strong>: Use botnames from the FFZ API</li>

    <h3><a name="CustomUsericons">Custom Usericons</a></h3>
    <p>Add entries to the table to show additional icons (<code>Addon</code>-Type)
        or replace the default icons (all other Types).</p>
    <p>The order of the entries can matter, they are looked at from the top:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All <code>Addon</code> icons that match are shown, unless you use
            the <code>$stop</code> restriction (see section <em>Restriction</em>
            below).</li>
        <li>When replacing default icons (all other Types), the first entry that
            matches is used. For example if you have several entries for
            replacing the Turbo badge, then the first one from the top that
            matches is used.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Custom Usericon Properties</h3>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Type</dt>
        <dd>A type of <code>Addon</code> will add an additional badge. All
            Addon-badges that matche the Restrictions are shown at once.</dd>
        <dd>Other types replace an already shown default badge. For example
            adding an entry of Type <code>Turbo</code> allows you to define a
            custom icon for all Turbo badges shown in chat. Accordingly, if you
            selected <code>Bits</code> it would target all variations of the
            Bits badge.</dd>
        <dd>The Type <code>Other Twitch</code> allows you to directly select a
            default icon via Twitch's own Badge ID/Version, which allows you to
            target badges that are not a supported Type.</dd>
        
        <dt>ID/Version</dt>
        <dd>You can only use this when you have the <code>Other Twitch</code>
            Type selected. This specifies the Badge ID/Version that Twitch uses
            to identify Badges, which allows you to target any Twitch Badge you
            want, including a specific variation.</dd>
        <dd>For example if you wanted to replace the 100-Bits Badge, you'd want
            to use <code>bits/100</code>. If you don't specify a Version, so
            just <code>bits</code>, then it matches all versions, in this case
            it would match all Bits Badges.</dd>
        <dd>If you are already connected to a channel, it should automatically
            populate the list with known ID/Version combinations. Note that some
            of these may only be used in some channels.</dd>
        
        <dt>Restriction</dt>
        <dd>This is similiar to the <a href="#Usercolors">Usercolors</a> settings,
        where you can enter special restrictions the user has to match in order
        for the icon to be displayed. What makes the most sense in this case is
        probably just entering a username (e.g. <code>serenity</code>) or an
        addressbook category (e.g. <code>$cat:vip</code>, which would refer to
        the category <code>vip</code>). If you keep this empty, then no restriction
        is applied.</dd>
        <dd>Specifying a <em>Type</em> other than <code>Addon</code> carries an
        implicit restriction, since e.g. the default moderator icons are only
        displayed if the user is a moderator.</dd>
        <dd>Normally you can only specify <em>one</em> restriction, but you can
            also add <strong>special restrictions</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><code>$stop</code> means if this icon matches (and is thus used),
                    it stops searching for further <code>Addon</code> icons. So
                    it's not really a restriction for <em>this</em> icon, but
                    rather a restriction that affects the following icons and
                    can be used to limit the number of <code>Addon</code> icons.</li>
                <li><code>$first</code> puts this <code>Addon</code> icon before
                    the regular icons. The <code>$stop</code> restriction only
                    applies to one group of <code>Addon</code> icons separately
                    (before or after the regular icons).</li>
                <li><code>$badge:&lt;ID/Version&gt;</code> matches a Twitch
                    Badge a user has. For example <code>$badge:bits/100</code>
                    will only target users that currently have the 100-Bits
                    Badge</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dd><em>Example:</em> <code>$cat:streamer $first</code> - Matches users
            in the Addressbook category <code>streamer</code> and puts the badge
            in front of the default ones.</dd>
        <dd><em>Example:</em> <code>lotsofs</code> - Matches a user by the name
            <code>lotsofs</code>.</dd>
        <dd><em>Example:</em> <code>$cat:vip $badge:bits</code> - Matches users
            in the Addresbook category <code>vip</code>, but only if they also
            have a Bits-Badge displayed.</dd>
        
        <dt>Channel</dt>
        <dd>You can enter a channel name here, so that the icon will only be
            displayed in that channel. You can add an exclamation mark in front
            of the channel name (like <code>!#channel</code>) to have it
            displayed in all channels <em>except</em> the one you specified.</dd>
        <dd>If you keep this empty, then it will be displayed in all channels.</dd>
        
        <dt>Image File</dt>
        <dd>The image to use. Must be a <code>.png</code> and is recommended to
            be about 18x18 pixels (because that is the default size). If you
            specify no image, then the matching default icon is removed.</dd>
        <dd>Chatty lookes for images in <code>&lt;working_directory&gt;/img/</code>
            (<a href="help-guide_folders.html#wdir">Chatty directories help</a>).
            You can click on <code>Image Folder</code> to show information about
            it and rescan to update the list.</dd>
        <dd>The <em>special image file name</em> <code>$default</code> will use
            the default image file, that would be shown without defining
            Custom Usericons. This can be useful if you e.g. want to replace all
            Badge Types, except for one, so you can define that one to use the
            default.</dd>
        <dd><em>Tip:</em> You should also be able to manually enter the full
            path to an image, in case you don't want to use the dedicated image
            folder. A filename starting with <code>http</code> is interpreted as
            URL.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p><em>Tip:</em> Jump to entries in the table by clicking into a column and
        start to type. Backspace or wait to get out of the search mode.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="Usercolors">Usercolors</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This allows you to specify your own usercolors for either certain types
        of users (mod, subscriber etc.) or specific usernames. There are special
    items that you can use to specify that (to specify a username, just enter
    it without anything else):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>$mod</code> - Moderators</li>
        <li><code>$sub</code> - Subscribers</li>
        <li><code>$turbo</code> - Turbo Users</li>
        <li><code>$admin</code> - Admins</li>
        <li><code>$staff</code> - Staff members</li>
        <li><code>$all</code> - All users, this can be used to specify a default
        color (should be put at the very end of the list)</li>
        <li><code>$broadcaster</code> - Broadcasters</li>
        <li><code>$cat:&lt;category&gt;</code> - A category from the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a></li>
        <li><code>#&lt;color code&gt;</code> - A Html color code, e.g. <code>#0000FF</code> for blue, which can
            be used to replace colors</li>
        <li><code>$color:&lt;color code or name&gt;</code> - A Html color code or name (names
            as hardcoded into Chatty, may be different from other programs), e.g. <code>$color:Blue</code> for blue,
            which can be used to replace colors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The order of the
    entries in the table matters, because it is checked from the top. If you
    were to put the <code>$all</code> item at the very top, any items below
    wouldn't do anything, because the first item would already match all users.
    This e.g. allows you to specify what color a user should have when he is
    both a subscriber and a moderator (by either putting <code>$mod</code>
    or <code>$sub</code> first).</p>
    
    <p>If an item is red and has "(error)" appended (e.g. "<span style="color:red">$color.Blue (error)</span>"),
    this means the item is invalid. In the example this is because a point has
    been used instead of a colon, so "$color:Blue" would be correct. This can
    also happen if it doesn't recognize the given color or the item is just in
    an invalid format.</p>

    <h3>General settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Highlight</strong>: Determines whether highlighting
        is enabled at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight own name</strong>: Makes messages that contain your
        own name (case-insensitive) highlighted, even if you didn't add it to the list manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight follow-up</strong>: After a highlighted message,
        also highlight the following messages of the same user for a certain time.</li>
        <li><strong>Check own text for highlights</strong>: Highlights your own messages if
        they match the criteria, which can be particularly useful to test whether your terms
        are being matched correctly. This does not mean that all your own messages
        are automatically highlighted, they still have to match one of the items
        added to the list. To match all your own messages you can use the <code>user:</code>
        prefix with your own name.</li>
        <li><strong>Check ignored messages</strong>: Only checks ignored messages
        for highlights if this is enabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Add terms to be highlighted</h3>
    <p>Add items to the list to make a message highlighted if any one of them
    match the message. The following two types of prefixes can be used to change
    highlighting behaviour per item.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="Highlight_Matching">Text Matching Prefixes</a></h3>
    <p>By default, matching is done case-insensitive and when the word or phrase
        appears anywhere in the message. However, you can add the following
        prefixes in front of the text to change this matching behaviour. You can
        only use one of these prefixes per item, because all text following the
        prefix is interpreted as text to match.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>cs:</code> makes it case-sensitive, so <code>cs:test</code>
            matches <code>test</code> but not <code>Test</code>.</li>
        <li><code>w:</code> matches at word boundaries, e.g. <code>w:anna</code>
            will match <code>anna</code> or <code>Anna:</code> but not
            <code>Hannah</code> or <code>annah</code>. <em>(Is actually just a
                shortcut for a special regex, so special regex characters will work.)</em></li>
        <li><code>wcs:</code> is the same as <code>w:</code>, but case-sensitive.</li>
        <li><code>start:</code> to match at the start, so <code>start:!bet</code> will
            match messages starting with <code>!bet</code>.</li>
        <li><code>re:</code> or <code>re*:</code> to use a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expression</a>:
            <ul>
                <li><code>re:</code> will always try to match the whole message,
                    so for example <code>re:GTA5</code> will only match the message
                    "GTA5", but not anything added to it even just a space like
                    "GTA5 ". Regular Expressions are also case-sensitive by
                    default, so "gta5" won't match either in this case, but
                    you can add <code>(?i)</code> for case-insensitive matching.
                    <br />
                    Example: <code>re:(?i).*\bGTA ?[V5]\b.*</code> will match
                    "GTA5", "GTA 5", "GTA V", "gta5", .. anywhere in the message
                    (<code>.*</code>), but only on word boundaries (<code>\b</code>)
                    and case-insensitive (<code>(?i)</code> in front).
                </li>
                <li><code>re*:</code> does the same as <code>re:</code> except
                    that a partial match anywhere in the message is enough, so
                    to get the same behaviour as in the above example you can
                    just use <code>re*:(?i)\bGTA&nbsp;?[V5]\b</code> (omitting
                    the surrounding <code>.*</code>).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Meta Prefixes</h3>
    <p>The following prefixes mostly influence which messages are matched,
        however they don't change the matching of the text itself, but instead
        provide other information for the highlight system. They can be
        placed in front of the Text Matching Prefixes (or the text if you don't
        have any other prefixes) and you can even use more than one per item.
        These prefixes have to be seperated from eachother and the text by a
        space.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>user:</code> to specifiy one exact username (case-insensitive)
            which should highlight only if this user send the message, doesn't
            search in the message itself.</li>
        <li><code>cat:</code> to specify a category the user who send the message
        should be in (as defined in the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a>).</li>
        <li><code>!cat:</code> to specify a category the user who send the message
        can NOT be in.</li>
        <li><code>chan:</code> to specify one or more channels the message has
        to be send in to match (several channels are specified as comma-seperated
        list, without spaces).</li>
        <li><code>!chan:</code> to specify one or more channels the message must
        NOT be send in to match.</li>
        <li><code>chanCat:</code> to specify one category the channel the message
        was send in has to be in (as defined in the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a>
        with the name of the channel, including leading #).</li>
        <li><code>!chanCat:</code> to specify one category the channel the message
        was send in can NOT be in.</li>
        <li><code>status:</code> to specify that the user has to have one of the
            given status codes (case-sensitive):
            <ul>
                <li><code>m</code> Moderator</li>
                <li><code>s</code> Subscriber</li>

                <li><code>t</code> Turbo User</li>
                <li><code>g</code> Global Moderator</li>
                <li><code>r</code> Bot as in <em>R</em>obot (depending on what the FFZ/BTTV APIs provides (if
                    enabled) and values in the <a href="help-setting_commands.html#bots">botNames</a> setting)</li>
                <li><code>M</code> User with any kind of moderator/special powers
                    (so Broadcaster/Moderator/Global Moderator/Admin/Staff combined)</li>
            </ul>
            For example: <code>status:st</code> matches
        all subscriber and turbo users.</li>
        <li><code>!status:</code> to specify that the user must NOT have any of
            the given status codes (see <code>status:</code> for codes). For example:

            badge by default (NOT a Subscriber, Turbo User or any kind of Moderator).</li>
        <li><code>color:</code> to specify a color other than the default one
            for displaying this highlight. <em>If you have items with a custom

                by other items (with another color or custom color)
            then the order of items is important so it displays the desired color.
            Items on the top are matched first, so move items up that should take
            precedence. For example <code>test</code> and
            <code>color:blue test2</code>. If <code>test</code> is on the top
            it will never get to the blue one, because <code>test</code> will

    <h3>General Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Ignore</strong>: Enable/disable the Ignore System
        altogether</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore own messages</strong>: Also ignore own messages (if
        they match), can be useful for testing</li>
        <li>What should happen with ignored messages:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hide</strong>: Don't show ignored messages in chat

                <li><strong>Show count</strong>: Shows the number of ignored messages
                in chat every 30s (if there were any), so you know that messages
                were ignored</li>
                <li><strong>Show names</strong>: Shows the name of the sender of
                any ignored messages, in a list similiar to MOD/UNMOD or JOIN/PART

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Ignored Users</h3>
    
    <p>The <code>Ignored Users</code> list allows you to ignore
        users in chat or prevent them from whispering you, which is possible via
        the main ignore list as well, but was added as a separate function to be
        more convenient. Aside from the settings, you can also ignore/unignore
        users via the User Context Menu.</p>
    
    <p>Ignored users are independant of the main ignore list, so they also apply
        if ignore is disabled.</p>
    
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Hide 'Ignored in chat' users from the userlist/joins/parts</dt>
        <dd>If enabled, prevents users on the 'Ignored in chat' list from
            showing up in the userlist and JOIN/PART/MOD/UNMOD events (which
            aren't enabled by default to be shown anyway).</dd>
        <dd>This only applies to the 'Ignored in chat' list, not to entries with
            the <code>user:</code> prefix on the main Ignore list.</dd>
        <dd>Users who are already on the userlist when you ignore them stay on
            it until they leave, you rejoin the channel or restart Chatty.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Sounds">Sounds</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Sounds are now integrated into the <a href="#Notifications">Notifications</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Notifications">Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The <strong>Events</strong> table can contain several entries that
        describe events and whether they should trigger a Desktop Notification
        and/or Sound.</p>
    
    <p>The entries are checked from the top and only the first enabled
        Notification and Sound of matching events are chosen, and then triggered
        if the Cooldowns allow it (given that any are configured).</p>
    
    <p>Example: You could have two "Highlights" events, the first restricted to
        a certain channel with a Notification/Sound and the second
        non-restricted with just a Notification. This way only Highlights in
        said channel would play a Sound (and maybe have different Notification
        colors) and all others just show a Notification. Note that if you were
        to switch those entries, then the channel-restricted one would never be
        chosen, because the non-restricted one already catches everything. So as
        a general rule, the more specific/restricted entries should always come
        first.</p>
    
    <p><img src="Notifications_example.jpg" /></p>
    
    <p>Possible <strong>event types</strong> that can be selected for an entry:</p>
    
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Stream Status</dt>
        <dd>A stream Chatty is watching (because you have it's chat open
            or you follow it) went online/offline or changed title.</dd>

        <dt>Highlights</dt>
        <dd>Chat Messages that were highlighted.</dd>

        <dt>Chat Message</dt>
        <dd>Any Chat Message (including highlighted ones, in this case
            the order of list entries can matter).</dd>
        
        <dt>Whisper</dt>
        <dd>Any Whisper message (including highlighted ones).</dd>

        <dt>User Joined &amp; User Left</dt>
        <dd>When a user is seen entering or leaving a chat. Note that
            this is quite unreliable, see <a href="help.html#userlist">Userlist and JOIN/PART</a>.</dd>

        <dt>New Followers</dt>
        <dd>When a new follower is detected <em>(this only works if the
                <a href="help.html#followers">Follower Dialog</a> is
                currently open)</em>.</dd>
                
        <dt>Subscriber Notification</dt>
        <dd>When a new Subscriber/Resub notification is received in chat.</dd>
        
        <dt>AutoMod Message</dt>
        <dd>When a new chat message filtered by AutoMod is received.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Event settings (Notification/Sound)</h3>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Channel</dt>
        <dd>Name of the channel this item should be restricted to.</dd>
        
        <dt>Match</dt>
        <dd>Match the given text or message, in the same format as for
            <a href="#Highlight">Highlighting</a> (although some prefixes won't
            work unless it's a chat message).</dd>
        
        <dt>Notification (Tab)</dt>
        <dd>A Desktop Notification, with customizable colors.</dd>
        
        <dt>Sound (Tab)</dt>
        <dd>Play the selected Sound.</dd>
        <dd>Specify a <code>Cooldown</code> to prevent this sound from playing
            too often.</dd>
        <dd><code>Passive Cooldown</code> will only play the sound if enough
            time has passed since this event was last matched. Or in other words
            it will reset the Cooldown every time the sound <em>would</em> have
            been played, even if it actually wasn't because another sound took
            precedence or the regular <code>Cooldown</code> didn't allow it.</dd>
        <dd>For example if your chat isn't very busy and you want to get
            notified of new messages so you notice, then you could add an event
            of type <code>Chat Message</code> with a <code>Passive Cooldown</code>
            of <code>5m</code>, which means the sound only plays if someone
            writes a message after the chat has been silent for at least 5 minutes.
            If on the other hand you would set it as a regular <code>Cooldown</code>
            it would play the sound after 5 minutes even if the chat has been
            busy non-stop, at which point you probably wouldn't need to be alerted
            since you're already paying attention to it.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>On both the <strong>Notification (Tab)</strong> and <strong>Sound (Tab)</strong>
        you can enable/disable the according action by choosing one of the
        following:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enabled</strong> - No requirements, always show it</li>
        <li><strong>Off</strong> - Never show</li>
        <li><strong>When channel/app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab AND when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel or app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab OR when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When app not active</strong> - Only when the program doesn't
        have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab</li>
        <li><strong>When channel active</strong> - Only when the channel IS the
        currently selected tab</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>General Notification Settings</h3>
    <p>There are different types of Notifications:</p>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Chatty Notifications</dt>
        <dd>The default popup Notification created by Chatty, with additional
            settings (see below).</dd>
        
        <dt>Tray Notifications (OS dependant)</dt>
        <dd>Native Tray Notifications, which will act differently depending on
            what OS you are on.</dd>
        
        <dt>Run OS Command</dt>
        <dd>Execute a program on your system, for example to run native
            notifications in Linux. <em>For advanced users only, read the help
            in the "Edit system command" dialog.</em></dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>If you have selected <strong>Chatty Notifications</strong>:</p>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Position</dt>
        <dd>The corner of the screen the notification is displayed.</dd>
        
        <dt>Screen</dt>
        <dd>On which screen the notification appears (auto means it's on the
            same screen as the Chatty window).</dd>
        
        <dt>Display Time</dt>
        <dd>How long the notification will be displayed by default. This can
            vary a bit depending on the situation.</dd>
        
        <dt>No User Activity</dt>
        <dd>This is a tricky one. If you enable this, then the notification will
            not be closed after the defined Display Time if no activity was
            detected in the last few seconds. This can be useful to still see
            notifications from a few minutes ago if you were away from the
            computer. The time defines when the notification will be closed no
            matter what, so older notifications won't stay there forever if you
            are away from the computer for a bit longer.</dd>
        <dd>Activity is tracked through two methods: The first method is
            tracking the system-wide mouse movements, which is done through an
            API that may not always return accurate information (e.g. if you are
            in a game) and it only checks the position every few seconds (only
            the last location is saved at any time for comparison). The second
            method detects activity only inside of Chatty, by tracking button
            presses and mouse actions (e.g. if you type a message, open a dialog
            etc.).</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>General Sound Settings</h3>
    <p>You can enable or disable all sounds here. Sounds are searched in the
    displayed folder, which is the current working directory, although you can
    also <code>Change</code> it to a folder of your choice. If you added or removed files,
    you may have to use <code>Rescan folder</code> to make the files show up in
    the list of sounds selectable in the event settings. You can <code>Open</code>
    the folder in your standard file browser from here to add files to it more
    quickly.</p>
    
    <p>The <strong>Output Device</strong> lets you choose the device on your
        computer the sounds gets output to. This is kind of experimental and may
        not work properly.</p>

    <h3>Followed Streams</h3>
    <p>Enable this to make Chatty get a list of your followed streams regulary
    so it can display notifications if their status changes. This simpy allows
    Chatty to know about your followed streams, so notifications aren't the only
    advantage. It also allows it to record the viewer count and status history
    of followed live streams as long as Chatty is running.</p>
    
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Log_to_file">Log to file</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you enable logging, chat messages (and more if enabled) will be written
    into a seperate textfile for each channel.</p>
    <h3>Channels</h3>
    <p>You can specify which channels should be logged:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>always</strong> - Log all channels without exception <em>(default)</em></li>
        <li><strong>blacklist</strong> - Log all channels, except the ones on
        the blacklist</li>
        <li><strong>whitelist</strong> - Log no channels, except the ones on the
        whitelist</li>
        <li><strong>off</strong> - Log no channels whatsoever</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Other Settings</h3>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Folder</dt>
        <dd>Select where to save the log files.</dd>
        
        <dt>Split Logs</dt>
        <dd>Start a new log file every Day, Week or Month.</dd>
        
        <dt>Channel Subdirectories</dt>
        <dd>Create a subfolder for each channel.</dd>
        
        <dt>Lock files while writing</dt>
        <dd>By default Chatty requests exclusive access while writing to the
            file, so that no other program can interfere. This can however cause
            issues if you try to open the log while in the channel, for example
            if you want to look something up for moderation, so disabling this
            setting can make sense. This means that you have to ensure yourself
            that only one instance of Chatty and no other programs write to or
            the lock the files.</dd>
        
        <dt>Timestamp</dt>
        <dd>Select the timestamp to be used in the logs.</dd>

    information:</p>
    
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Chat Info</dt>

                <li><strong>Keep location during session</strong>: Puts dialogs
                at the same position when you reopen them during the same
                session (so they are put on the default location when you open
                them the first time after starting Chatty).</li>
                <li><strong>Restore dialogs from last session</strong>: Puts
                dialogs at the same position they were at when you closed Chatty
                last session and also keeps the position during the session.</li>
                <li><strong>Reopen dialogs from last session</strong>: Reopens
                any dialogs that were open when you closed Chatty last session
                and also puts them at the same position they were before.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Restore position only if on screen</strong>: If enabled,
            restores the position on start only if a large portion of the top of
            the dialog/window is visible on screen. This is to prevent dialogs
            from being lost off-screen by accident.</li>
        <li><strong>Attach dialogs position to main window</strong>: If enabled,
        moves the dialogs like Channel Info or Admin Dialog along with the
        main window, so they always keep the same relative position. You can
        still move the dialogs by themselves of course.</li>

            some occasions, but not for URLs in chat.</li>
        <li><strong>Always show chat scrollbar</strong>: Always show the vertical
        scrollbar in the chat window (there should never be a horizontal one),
        even if no scrolling is necessary. This can be useful for using window
        capture for streaming, because you can always keep the same subregion.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimize to tray</strong>: When minimizing the main Chatty
        window, it will be minimized to tray.</li>
        <li><strong>Close to tray</strong>: Closing the main Chatty window will
        not actually exit the program, but instead minimize it to tray. You can
        actually close the program via <code>Main - Exit</code> or the tray icon
        context menu.</li>

        <li><strong>Enable userlist by default</strong>: Show the userlist by
            default. When you disable this the userlist will be entirely hidden
            from the start. You can always use a shortcut (<kbd>Shift+F10</kbd>

    <h3>Popout</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Restore location/size</strong>: When you close a popout
        window then it's location/size is saved and used for the next popout
        window that is opened. Each saved location/size is only used once, if
        there is none left then the default attributes are used. This is also
        saved between sessions (attributes of popouts that are open when you
        close Chatty are saved as well).</li>
        <li><strong>Close popout when only channel</strong>: When you have a
        channel popout window open and close the last channel in the main window,
        then the popout window will automatically be closed and the channel
        moved to the main window. Disable this if the popout shouldn't be closed

    <h3>Write Stream Status</h3>
    <p>You can let Chatty write information (title, game, viewercount) of a
        certain stream to a file. The file will be written to the subfolder <code>exported</code> of the settings directory
    (enter <code>/dir</code> to find out where that is). Stream information is
    only written if Chatty gets that data, so for it to work properly you need
    to currently have the channel of that stream open in Chatty. (When you change
    the setting, data will be requested once for testing, but you have to be in
    the channel for it to be updated regulary.)</p>
    
    <p>To save stream information to a file, you have to define it in the
    setting. Each line represents one stream/file and the content to write into
    the file. The format for each line is:</p>
    
    <p style="padding-left:10px;"><code>&lt;streamname&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [online/offline] &lt;content&gt;</code></p>
    
    <p>The optional parameter <code>online/offline</code> defines whether to
    write the given content to the file when the stream is online or offline. So
    you could for example define one line for online, which writes the viewercount
    and another for offline which writes "Offline" or maybe no content at all, which clears the file.
    If you only define one for online, then
    the file is not written if the stream is offline, so the previous info will
    stay in there. If you ommit this parameter, then online is assumed.</p>
    
    <p>The following codes in the content will be replaced with the appropriate data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>%title</code> - The title of the stream</li>
        <li><code>%game</code> - The game of the stream</li>
        <li><code>%viewers</code> - The current viewercount</li>
        <li><code>%followers</code> - The current number of followers, only
            updates correctly when the Followers Dialog for this channel is open
            (Main Menu - Extra - Followers)</li>
        <li><code>%subscribers</code> - The current number of subscribers, only
            updates correctly when the Subscribers Dialog for this channel is
            open (Main Menu - Extra - Subscribers)</li>
        <li><code>%viewersf</code>, <code>%followersf</code>, <code>%subscribersf</code>
            - The same as above, but formatted numbers (e.g. <code>1,532</code>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example which will write two files (if joined to #joshimuz):</p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
    <code>
        joshimuz title.txt %title (%viewers Viewers)<br />
        joshimuz title.txt offline Stream offline<br />
        joshimuz game.txt %game<br />
        joshimuz game.txt offline
    </code>
    </p>
    <p>If the stream is online, it writes the title and viewercount to <code>title.txt</code>
        and the game to <code>game.txt</code>.
    If the stream is offline it writes "Stream offline" to <code>title.txt</code> and empties
    <code>game.txt</code>.</p>

                <p>You can add hotkeys for certain actions. In general, there
                are the following types of hotkeys:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular hotkeys</strong>, which will only trigger if the main Chatty
                    window has focus (or a popout window).</li>
                    <li><strong>Application-wide hotkeys</strong>, which will trigger anywhere in
                    Chatty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global hotkeys</strong>, which are supposed to trigger everywhere
                    on your computer (Windows only, Hotkey version required). However some hotkeys may
                    not work, so just try it out.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With the <strong>Enable global hotkeys</strong> setting you
                can enable/disable the currently defined global hotkeys if your
                Chatty version supports global hotkeys. It does <em>not</em> do
                anything on it's own, it just toggles global hotkeys you defined
                on and off, in case you only need them sometimes and they
                interfer with other programs you use. You can also toggle that
                setting in the main menu under <code>Extra - Options</code> or
                use setting commands to change the <code>globalHotkeysEnabled</code>
                setting directly.</p>

                <h3>Adding/Editing hotkeys</h3>
                <p>When adding or changing a hotkey you have the following options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> The action to perform when the
                        hotkey is pressed. If you select <code>Custom Command</code>,
                        you have to enter the command to perform in the field below
                        (just the name of the command, see <a href="#Commands">Commands</a>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Hotkey:</strong> The key or key combination that
                    has to be pressed to perform the action, click into the field
                    and press the key or key combination you want to use.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the hotkey shows as being already used you may
                        still add it, but having more than one action defined
                        for the same hotkey will not trigger all the actions
                        when the hotkey is pressed, but a random one,
                        so it doesn't really make a lot of sense.
                        Adding it anyway can be sensible if you're currently
                        changing several hotkeys and will change the other
                        hotkey afterwards, so each key combination is only used
                        once.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Type:<ul><li><strong>Regular:</strong> Regular hotkey, which will only
                        trigger if the main window or a popout is focused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> Application-wide hotkey,
                        which will trigger if any Chatty component is focused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global:</strong> Global hotkey, which will
                    trigger anywhere on your computer (only works with the hotkey
                    version of Chatty and if it loaded properly, Windows only).</li></ul></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Delay:</strong> The delay between performed actions,
                        in 1/10th of a second,
                    if this is 0 then there will be no delay required, otherwise
                    specifying a delay of e.g. <code>50</code> will execute the
                    action only once per 5 seconds, even if you keep the hotkey
                    pressed. This can be useful for actions you normally would
                    only want to execute once (e.g. running a commercial,
                    sending a message to chat) and
                    that you don't want to spam by accident.</li>

        of a nickname in chat and then press TAB to complete it. To learn how to
        use TAB Completion <a href="help.html#nickCompletion">check out the general help</a>.</p>
                
    <h3>TAB Completion</h3>
    <p>Either <strong>TAB</strong> or <strong>Shift-TAB</strong> can be pressed
        after some text to initiate Completion, and here you can change what
        type of Completion each should do:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Names: Complete usernames in the current chat</li>
        <li>Emotes: Complete emotes you have access to</li>
        <li>Names, then Emotes: Both usernames and emotes appear in the result,
            but sorted so that usernames are listed first</li>
        <li>Emotes, then Names: Same as previous, but emotes are listed first</li>
        <li>Custom Completion: Complete the keys specified for Custom Completion
            (without having to use a <code>.</code> prefix)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In addition to this there are special cases where a certain type of
        Completion is chosen independant of these settings:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Prefixing <code>@</code> always completes usernames</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>/</code> always completes command names</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>:</code> always completes Emoji codes (not Twitch Emotes!)</li>
        <li>Prefixing <code>.</code> always performs Custom Completion</li>
        <li>Certain commands such as <code>/ban</code> always complete usernames</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Localized Names</h3>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Prefer Regular name for username-based commmands</dt>
        <dd>If you complete a username after a command like <code>/ban</code>
            which needs a regular username as parameter, then always prefer the
            regular name.</dd>
        
        <dt>Include all name types in result</dt>
        <dd>If a user has a Localized name, or you have a
            <a href="help.html#customNames">Custom name</a> set, then not only
            the name that matched, but also the other types of names are added
            to the result.</dd>
        <dd><em>Example:</em> If a user is called <code>test</code> and has the
            Localized Name <code>名前</code>, then entering
            <code>tes</code> and <kbd>TAB</kbd> will show in the results both
            <code>test (名前)</code> and
            <code>名前 (test)</code>, so you can select either name by cycling
            through the results via <kbd>TAB</kbd> as usual.</dd>
        <dd>
            <dl class="dl-settings-sub">
                <dt>Only when no more than two matches</dt>
                <dd>Only include all name types when no more than two names
                    match, so that you don't have to cycle through all the
                    different name types when you have a larger list.</dd>
                <dd><em>Tip:</em> Once you found the right name, you can move the cursor
                    to leave completion, and then press <kbd>TAB</kbd> again to
                    complete the name again to get the other name types again.</dd>
            </dl>
        </dd>
    </dl>
        
    <h3>Apperance / Behaviour</h3>
    <dl class="dl-settings">
        <dt>Show popup</dt>
        <dd>Shows a small window with information about the current completion
            if there is more than one matching result. It shows your position in
            the results when cycling through them (and how many there are in
            total) as well as a limited list of results.</dd>
        
        <dt>Max Items Shown</dt>
        <dd>How many items (results) are shown in the popup at once.</dd>
        <dd>You can set this to 0 to not show any items (and thus only your
            position in the results when cycling through and how many results
            there are in total).</dd>
        
        <dt>Complete to common prefix</dt>
        <dd>Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> only completes up to the common prefix for
            all found matches, giving you the opportunity to refine your search
            by adding more characters and then pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> again, or
            just press TAB again to start cycling through the results.</dd>
        <dd>With this setting disabled, it immediately completes to the first
            found result, allowing you to directly cycle through by pressing
            <kbd>TAB</kbd> repeatedly.</dd>
        
        <dt>Sorting</dt>
        <dd>Changes how the matching usernames are sorted for completion (only
            applies to usernames, not to other stuff like emotes or setting
            names, which are always alphabetical).</dd>
        <dd>
            <dl class="dl-settings-sub">
                <dt>Predictive</dt>
                <dd>Gives users that were recently active in chat a higher
                    priority, and users with highlighted messages the highest.
                    This way people you currently talk to (or that mentioned
                    you) probably appear under the first few results.</dd>
                
                <dt>Alphabetical</dt>
                <dd>Sorts names alphabetical.</dd>
                
                <dt>Userlist</dt>
                <dd>Sorts names the same as in the userlist.</dd>
            </dl>
        </dd>
        
        
    </dl>

    <h3><a name="TAB_Completion-custom">Custom Completion Items</a><a name="Completion-custom"></a></h3>
    
    <p>Custom Completion allows you to add your own keyword/value pairs for
        completion. Custom Completion can always be performed by prepending the
        keyword with a dot (<code>.</code>) and then pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd>
        or <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd>, or by selecting Custom Completion for the
        <strong>TAB</strong> or <strong>Shift-TAB</strong> setting, in which
        case no prefix is required.</p>

    <p><em>Example:</em> Add <code>chatty</code> as <em>Key</em> and
        <code>http://chatty.github.io</code> as <em>Value</em> and then in the
        inputbox type <code>.chatty</code> (notice the dot in front) and press
        <kbd>TAB</kbd> to complete it to the URL.</p>
                
    <p>Custom Completion items can only have one completion, so you can't have
        <code>.chatty</code> complete to several different values.</p>
                
    <p>Besides the Settings Dialog, you can also use the <code>/customCompletion</code>
        command to modify custom completion items:</p>
                
    <ul>
        <li><code>/customCompletion add &lt;item&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - Add an item</li>
        <li><code>/customCompletion set &lt;item&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - Change an item if it already exists (or otherwise add it)</li>
        <li><code>/customCompletion remove &lt;item&gt;</code> - Remove an item</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Remember that you can also use TAB Completion for command names. Kappab</p>
