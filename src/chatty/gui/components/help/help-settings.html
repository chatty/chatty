    <p>This page details some of the settings in the Settings Dialog
        (<code>Main Menu - Settings</code>). Also try hovering over settings
    in the settings dialog itself, sometimes you can get a tooltip with some
    additional information. You can open this help in the settings dialog by
    clicking on the "Help" link on the bottom left.</p>

    </h2>
    <h3>Chat Font</h3>
    <p>Change font and font size by clicking on <code>Select font</code>.</p>
    
    <h3>Input Font</h3>
    <p>Input font is restricted to two fonts by default, because other fonts
        cause issues due to a bug in Java. The number behind the font is the
        font size. You can manually change this setting via
        <a href="help-setting_commands.html">Setting Commands</a> (as with most
        settings) if you really need another font, but pay attention to the
        <a href="help-setting_commands.html#font">note</a> about the adverse
        effects it may have.</p>
    
    <h3>Startup</h3>
    <p>You can select what will happen when you start Chatty:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Do nothing</strong> - Just do nothing special</li>
        <li><strong>Open connect dialog</strong> - Open dialog to connect</li>
        <li><strong>Connect and join specified channels</strong> - Connect
        immediately and join the channels specified in the field below. You can
        define several channels by seperating them with a comma.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect and join previously open channels</strong> - Connect
        immediately and join the channels you had open when you closed Chatty.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect and join favorited channels</strong> - Connect
        immediately and join the channels that are favorited in the Channel
        Favorites/History dialog.</li>
    </ul>

    </h2>
    <h3>Deleted Messages (Timeouts/Bans)</h3>
    <p>This allows you to define how timeouts or bans are displayed in Chatty.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are three options for deleted messages:<ul>
        <li><strong>Delete Message</strong> completely replaces the message with
            <code>&lt;message deleted&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike through</strong> will keep the whole message displayed, but
        crossed out.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike through, shorten</strong> is same as the previous one, but
        it will also shorten the message to the defined number of characters, so long
        spam messages don't take as much space, but can mostly still be identified what
        they were about. Shortened messages are indicated by the points at the end
        that are <em>not</em> crossed out (e.g. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Deleted spam message Long copy pas</span>..).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Show ban messages</strong>: In addition to handling the deleted
        message, Chatty can also show a message like
        <code>&lt;name&gt; has been banned from talking</code> once the timeout
    or ban is issued.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine ban messages</strong>: Chatty can combine ban messages,
    which means if several bans/timeouts are issued for the same user within 10
    seconds, only one message is shown for them, with the number of bans shown
    after the message, e.g. <code>&lt;name&gt; has been banned from talking (3)</code>.
    Ban messages are not combined if a new message from the banned user was
    received in the meantime.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Timestamp</strong>: Whether to show a timestamp in front of
        chat messages and what format it should have. If you want a different
        format from the ones provided here, you can use the command
        <code>/set timestamp &lt;format&gt;</code>. The format can be anything
        specified by the Java
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">SimpleDateFormat</a>
        class.</li>
        <li><strong>Show mod/unmod messages</strong>: Whether to show the MOD/UNMOD
            messages as they come in from Twitch Chat. These messages are send
            not only when someone was modded/unmodded but also when a mod joins
            or leaves the chat.</li>
        <li><strong>Show joins/parts</strong>: Show joins/parts, which
        are always kind of delayed, so don't take them too seriously (only works
        when <code>Advanced - Correct Userlist</code> is enabled).</li>
        <li><strong>Show stream status in chat</strong> outputs the stream status
        (title and game) in the chat window on join and when it changes
        (when the stream goes offline or online or changes the title or game).</li>
        <li><strong>/me messages colored</strong>: Show action messages colored
        like in webchat.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter combining characters</strong>: Replaces certain ranges of
        Unicode characters. Those characters are used in some
        languages to combine characters, but can apparently cause errors in some
        cases. The filter applies to the main chat window and the recent messages
        in the User Info Dialog (but not e.g. the chatlog written to file).
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Off</strong> - Do nothing</li>
                <li><strong>Lenient</strong> - Replaces at least 3 characters in a row with stars (****), which preserves some legitimate use</li>
                <li><strong>Strict</strong> - Replaces any number of characters in a row with stars (****), use this if you have performance
                problems when someone posts these kind of characters</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><a name="capitalization">Name Capitalization</a></h3>
    <p>Names in Twitch Chat are send all-lowercase by default, however there is
        an IRCv3 tag send with each message with the display name which Chatty
        can use to show correct capitalization. You have the following settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capitalized Names (First Letter)</strong> simply makes the
        first letter of names uppercase. This will be correct for many names,
        but by far not for all (names might have capital letters in the middle
        or be all-lowercase). You can enable this if you simply prefer it this
        way.</li>
        <li><strong>Correctly Capitalized Names</strong> uses the capitalization
        send in the IRCv3 tag with each message and should be what the user
        configured. In very rare cases the display nick may differ more than the
        capitalization. This is enabled by default.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>The previous function that requested correctly capitalized names from the
    Twitch API has been removed. This also means that the associated commands
    (<code>/refreshCase</code>, <code>/setCase</code> and <code>/getCase</code>)
    have been removed as well. If you want to customize the capitalization of someone else's
    name locally, you can now use the <a href="help.html#customNames">Custom Names feature</a>.
    The names in the userlist will not be correctly capitalized until Chatty has
    received a message from that user during this session.</em></p>

    </h2>
    <h3>Chat Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scroll down after <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> seconds of inactivity</strong>: If you scrolled
            up in chat but haven't moved scrollposition in the given number of seconds, it will scroll down
            if new messages come in. This prevents new messages from being hidden
            indefinitely if you accidently stayed scrolled up.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat buffer size</strong>: How many lines of text are kept
            for each channel in chat to scroll back to.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Pause Chat</h3>
    <p>The Pause Chat feature stops Chatty from scrolling down when you move the
        mouse over chat. This can be useful if you want to click specific stuff
        in a fast moving chat, for example if you are moderating or just want to
        click on an emote to see what it is.</p>
    
    <p><em>Please note:</em> This will not work properly until the chat window is filled with
        text, because only then will Chatty actively scroll down. Also, this
        only stops Chatty from actively scrolling down, so if e.g. a big message
        is being timed out and thus shortened, stuff may still move around accordingly
        (which in that case couldn't really be prevented anyway).</p>
    
    <p>Chat is paused as long as you move the mouse over chat or if you hold
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (and initiated pausing by moving the mouse). A little
        popup in the top-right will indicate that the chat is paused.</p>
    
    <p>Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> basicially acts as if you moved the mouse
        continuously.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pause chat when moving the mouse over it:</strong> Enables
        this feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Require Ctrl being pressed to start pausing chat:</strong>
            If this is enabled, you need to have <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> pressed to
            start pausing chat when moving the mouse over it. Once it's paused,
            you can let go of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and it will stay paused as long as
            you move the mouse (or hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> again to keep it paused
            even when not moving the mouse, as usual).</li>
        <li><strong>Run command when clicking on user (holding Ctrl):</strong>
            When you select a command here, then clicking on a user in chat
            while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> will run the command on that user. You
            can <a href="help-setting_commands.html#chat">manually edit</a> this
            setting to use another command.</li>

            emotes and Mod Icons (where available). <em>Requires a restart to take
                effect when you change it.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Enable FFZ Mod Icon</strong>: Show the FFZ Mod Icon instead of the regular
            Mod Icon (where available). <em>Requires FrankerFaceZ setting to be enabled.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Allow animated emotes</strong>: Show animated emotes (BTTV GIF emotes).</li>
        <li><strong>Scale</strong>: The relative size of how emotes are displayed in chat (100% is regular size).</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum Height</strong>: The maximum height of emotes in chat (in pixels). Use 0 to allow any height.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotes Dialog</strong>: The relative size of how emotes are displayed in the Emotes Dialog (100% is regular size).</li>
        <li><strong>Double-click on emote closes Emote Dialog</strong>: If
            enabled, double-clicking on an emote in the Emote Dialog closes the
            Emote Dialog.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Ignored Emotes</h3>
    <p>Emotes added to this list will not be turned into an image, but instead
        are just shown as their emote code.</p>
    <p>The code added to the list has to be the
    exact code used internally to find the emote in the messages. Usually this is simply
    the emote code as you would type it in chat, but some emotes have a special syntax
    that you might not even know (e.g. <code>:)</code> has <code>\:-?\)</code> as actual code).
    It is recommended to use the emote context menu (right-click on an emote in chat) to
    ignore emotes, because then the correct code will automatically be added to
    the list.</p>

        <li><strong>Enable Bot Badge</strong>: Enables showing of the bot badge

        list of bot names comes from different sources: The <code>botNames</code>
        setting, the BTTV API and the FFZ API.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BTTV</strong>: Use botnames from the BTTV API</li>
            <li><strong>FFZ</strong>: Use botnames from the FFZ API</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Custom Usericons</h3>
    <p>By adding entries to the table you can either replace the default icons (Mod, Turbo, Subscriber, ..)
    or add additional icons for certain users or addressbook categories. The order
    of the entries can matter, they are matched from the top, so if more than one
    icon matches that is supposed to replace a default icon, then the first one
    is used. If more than one <code>Addon</code> icon matches, then all are used
    (unless you use the <code>$stop</code> restriction, see section <em>Restriction</em> below).</p>
    
    <p>You have the following options when you add/edit an item:</p>
    <dl class="paragraphs">
        <dt>Type</dt>
        <dd>The type determines whether a default icon will be replaced
            (if you choose <code>Moderator, Subscriber, Turbo, ..</code>) or if
            it should be an additional icon added after the default ones (<code>Addon</code>).
            Currently, you can have as many Addon-Icons as you want and they are
            all displayed at once (if they match the requirements of course).</dd>
        
        <dt>Restriction</dt>
        <dd>This is similiar to the <a href="#Usercolors">Usercolors</a> settings,
        where you can enter special restrictions the user has to match in order
        for the icon to be displayed. What makes the most sense in this case is
        probably just entering a username (e.g. <code>serenity</code>) or an
        addressbook category (e.g. <code>$cat:vip</code>, which would refer to
        the category <code>vip</code>). If you keep this empty, then no restriction
        is applied.</dd>
        <dd>Specifying a <em>Type</em> other than <code>Addon</code> carries an
        implicit restriction, since e.g. the default moderator icons are only
        displayed if the user is a moderator.</dd>
        <dd>Normally you can only specify <em>one</em> restriction, but you can
            also add  <strong>special restrictions</strong> for <code>Addon</code>
            icons:
            <ul>
                <li><code>$stop</code> means if this icon matches (and is thus used),
                    it stops searching for further <code>Addon</code> icons. So
                    it's not really a restriction for <em>this</em> icon, but
                    rather a restriction that affects the following icons and
                    can be used to limit the number of <code>Addon</code> icons.</li>
                <li><code>$first</code> puts this <code>Addon</code> icon before
                    the regular icons. The <code>$stop</code> restriction only
                    applies to one group of <code>Addon</code> icons separately
                    (before or after the regular icons).</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dd>Examples: <code>$cat:streamer $first</code>, <code>lotsofs</code></dd>
        
        <dt>Channel</dt>
        <dd>This is another requirement that also has to be met in order for the
        icon to be displayed. You can entere a channel name here, so that the
        icon will only be displayed in that channel. You can add an exclamation
        mark in front of the channel name (like <code>!#channel</code>) to have
        it displayed in all channels except the one you specified. If you keep
        this empty, then it will be displayed in all channels.</dd>
        
        <dt>Image File</dt>
        <dd>The image file to use for the icon. Must be a <code>.png</code> and
        should usually be about 18x18 pixels (because that is the size of the
        default icons). The image files are looked for in the <code>/img</code>
        subfolder of the working directory (similiar to the <code>/sounds</code>
        folder). You can click on <code>Image Folder</code> to show information
        about it and rescan it to update the list of images in the dropdown menu.</dd>
        <dd>You can add the special Image File name <code>$ffz</code> which will
        make it use a FrankerFaceZ icon for that, if available (this only really
        applies if you use the <em>Type</em> <code>Moderator</code> and want to
        replace the moderator icon in all channels execept the ones that have a
        FFZ Mod Icon).</dd>
        <dd>You should also be able to specify the full path to an image, if you
        don't want to use the dedicated image folder. A filename starting with
        <code>http</code> is interpreted as URL.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Usercolors">Usercolors</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This allows you to specify your own usercolors for either certain types
        of users (mod, subscriber etc.) or specific usernames. There are special
    items that you can use to specify that (to specify a username, just enter
    it without anything else):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>$mod</code> - Moderators</li>
        <li><code>$sub</code> - Subscribers</li>
        <li><code>$turbo</code> - Turbo Users</li>
        <li><code>$admin</code> - Admins</li>
        <li><code>$staff</code> - Staff members</li>
        <li><code>$all</code> - All users, this can be used to specify a default
        color (should be put at the very end of the list)</li>
        <li><code>$broadcaster</code> - Broadcasters</li>
        <li><code>$cat:&lt;category&gt;</code> - A category from the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a></li>
        <li><code>#&lt;color code&gt;</code> - A Html color code, e.g. <code>#0000FF</code> for blue, which can
            be used to replace colors</li>
        <li><code>$color:&lt;color code or name&gt;</code> - A Html color code or name (names
            as hardcoded into Chatty, may be different from other programs), e.g. <code>$color:Blue</code> for blue,
            which can be used to replace colors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The order of the
    entries in the table matters, because it is checked from the top. If you
    were to put the <code>$all</code> item at the very top, any items below
    wouldn't do anything, because the first item would already match all users.
    This e.g. allows you to specify what color a user should have when he is
    both a subscriber and a moderator (by either putting <code>$mod</code>
    or <code>$sub</code> first).</p>
    
    <p>If an item is red and has "(error)" appended (e.g. "<span style="color:red">$color.Blue (error)</span>"),
    this means the item is invalid. In the example this is because a point has
    been used instead of a colon, so "$color:Blue" would be correct. This can
    also happen if it doesn't recognize the given color or the item is just in
    an invalid format.</p>

    <h3>General settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Highlight</strong>: Determines whether highlighting
        is enabled at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight own name</strong>: Makes messages that contain your
        own name (case-insensitive) highlighted, even if you didn't add it to the list manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight follow-up</strong>: After a highlighted message,
        also highlight the following messages of the same user for a certain time.</li>
        <li><strong>Check own text for highlights</strong>: Highlights your own messages if
        they match the criteria, which can be particularly useful to test whether your terms
        are being matched correctly. This does not mean that all your own messages
        are automatically highlighted, they still have to match one of the items
        added to the list. To match all your own messages you can use the <code>user:</code>
        prefix with your own name.</li>
        <li><strong>Check ignored messages</strong>: Only checks ignored messages
        for highlights if this is enabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Add terms to be highlighted</h3>
    <p>Add items to the list to make a message highlighted if any one of them
    match the message. The following two types of prefixes can be used to change
    highlighting behaviour per item.</p>
    
    <h3>Text Matching Prefixes</h3>
    <p>By default, matching is done case-insensitive and when the word or phrase
        appears anywhere in the message. However, you can add the following
        prefixes in front of the text to change this matching behaviour. You can
        only use one of these prefixes per item, because all text following the
        prefix is interpreted as text to match.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>cs:</code> makes it case-sensitive, so <code>cs:test</code>
            matches <code>test</code> but not <code>Test</code>.</li>
        <li><code>w:</code> matches at word boundaries, e.g. <code>w:anna</code>
            will match <code>anna</code> or <code>Anna:</code> but not
            <code>Hannah</code> or <code>annah</code>. <em>(Is actually just a
                shortcut for a special regex, so special regex characters will work.)</em></li>
        <li><code>wcs:</code> is the same as <code>w:</code>, but case-sensitive.</li>
        <li><code>start:</code> to match at the start, so <code>start:!bet</code> will
            match messages starting with <code>!bet</code>.</li>
        <li><code>re:</code> to use a regular expression, e.g. <code>re:(?i).*\bGTA ?[V5]\b.*</code>
        to match GTA5, GTA 5, GTA V, gta5, .. (as a word) anywhere in the message. Note
        that the regex always tries to match the entire message, so you have to
        add the appropriate wildcards to match parts anywhere in the message.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Meta Prefixes</h3>
    <p>The following prefixes mostly influence which messages are matched,
        however they don't change the matching of the text itself, but instead
        provide other information for the highlight system. They can be
        placed in front of the Text Matching Prefixes (or the text if you don't
        have any other prefixes) and you can even use more than one per item.
        These prefixes have to be seperated from eachother and the text by a
        space.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>user:</code> to specifiy one exact username (case-insensitive)
            which should highlight only if this user send the message, doesn't
            search in the message itself.</li>
        <li><code>cat:</code> to specify a category the user who send the message
        should be in (as defined in the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a>).</li>
        <li><code>!cat:</code> to specify a category the user who send the message
        can NOT be in.</li>
        <li><code>chan:</code> to specify one or more channels the message has
        to be send in to match (several channels are specified as comma-seperated
        list, without spaces).</li>
        <li><code>!chan:</code> to specify one or more channels the message must
        NOT be send in to match.</li>
        <li><code>chanCat:</code> to specify one category the channel the message
        was send in has to be in (as defined in the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a>
        with the name of the channel, including leading #).</li>
        <li><code>!chanCat:</code> to specify one category the channel the message
        was send in can NOT be in.</li>
        <li><code>status:</code> to specify that the user has to have one of the
            given status codes (case-sensitive):
            <ul>
                <li><code>m</code> Moderator</li>
                <li><code>s</code> Subscriber</li>
                <li><code>a</code> Admin</li>
                <li><code>f</code> Staff</li>
                <li><code>b</code> Broadcaster</li>
                <li><code>t</code> Turbo User</li>
                <li><code>g</code> Global Moderator</li>
                <li><code>r</code> Bot as in <em>R</em>obot (depending on what the FFZ/BTTV APIs provides (if
                    enabled) and values in the <a href="help-setting_commands.html#bots">botNames</a> setting)</li>
                <li><code>M</code> User with any kind of moderator/special powers
                    (so Broadcaster/Moderator/Global Moderator/Admin/Staff combined)</li>
            </ul>
            For example: <code>status:st</code> matches
        all subscriber and turbo users.</li>
        <li><code>!status:</code> to specify that the user must NOT have any of
            the given status codes (see <code>status:</code> for codes). For example:
            <code>!status:stM</code> matches all 'normal' users that have no
            badge by default (NOT a Subscriber, Turbo User or any kind of Moderator).</li>
        <li><code>color:</code> to specify a color other than the default one
            for displaying this highlight. <em>If you have items with a custom
                color defined, which match something that might also be matched
                by other items (with another color or custom color)
            then the order of items is important so it displays the desired color.
            Items on the top are matched first, so move items up that should take
            precedence. For example <code>test</code> and
            <code>color:blue test2</code>. If <code>test</code> is on the top
            it will never get to the blue one, because <code>test</code> will
            always match when <code>test2</code> would match as well.</em></li>
            <li><code>config:</code> to specify one or more options (seperated
            by comma) that changes the behaviour):
            <ul>
                <li><code>silent</code> - Disable sounds for this item</li>
                <li><code>!notify</code> - Disable notifications for this item</li>
                <li><code>info</code> - This item applies to info messages instead
                of regular user messages (works only for Ignoring messages at the
                moment)</li>
            </ul></li>

    <h2>
        <a name="Ignore">Ignore</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Allows you to ignore chat messages that match the specified text or -
        using prefixes - that match other properties like ignoring messages of a
        specific user. Ignored messages get added to a special dialog that can
        be opened via <code>View - Ignored</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>The matching of messages works the same as the <a href="#Highlight">Highlights</a>
        system, please see that help for information on that. For quick
        reference here just a few examples:
    </p>
    
    <dl>

        notice the leading <code>#</code>)</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>General Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Ignore</strong>: Enable/disable the Ignore System
        altogether</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore own messages</strong>: Also ignore own messages (if
        they match), can be useful for testing</li>
        <li>What should happen with ignored messages:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hide</strong>: Don't show ignored messages in chat
                    at all (they still get added to the <code>Ignored</code> dialog)</li>
                <li><strong>Show count</strong>: Shows the number of ignored messages
                in chat every 30s (if there were any), so you know that messages
                were ignored</li>
                <li><strong>Show names</strong>: Shows the name of the sender of
                any ignored messages, in a list similiar to MOD/UNMOD or JOIN/PART
                messages</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Only show if ignored messages dialog is not open</strong>:
        Only show what is configured for "What should happen with ignored messages"
        when the ignored messages dialog isn't currently open.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The <code>Ignored Users</code> list allows you to ignore
        users in chat or prevent them from whispering you, which is possible via
        the main ignore list as well, but was added as a separate function to be
        more convenient. Aside from the settings, you can also ignore/unignore
        users via the User Context Menu.</p>
    
    <p>Ignored users are independant of the main ignore list, so they also apply
        if ignore is disabled.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Sounds">Sounds</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>General Sound Settings</h3>
    <p>You can enable or disable all sounds here. Sounds are searched in the
    displayed folder, which is the current working directory. Any valid sound
    files in the folder should be selectable as a sound to be played. If you
    added or removed files, you may have to use <code>Rescan folder</code> to
    make the files show up in the list. You can open the folder in your standard
    file browser from here to add files to it more quickly.</p>
    
    <h3>Sound Types Settings</h3>
    <p>You can specify requirements, soundfile, volume and delay for
        different types of events:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a message is highlighted</li>
        <li>When a stream changes status (online/offline/changed title/changed game)</li>
        <li>When any message in received in any open channel</li>
        <li>When someone joins/leaves any open channel</li>
        <li>When a new follower is detected <em>(this only works if the <a href="help.html#followers">Follower
                    Dialog</a> is currently open)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can set a delay (seconds) so that the same sound won't be played twice during
    the set number of seconds. So if e.g. 3 highlighted messages come in within
    10 seconds and the delay is set to 15 seconds, only one sound will be played.</p>
    
    <p>Each sound has different options for when the sound should be played. See
        the <a href="#Notifications">Notification Settings</a> for help on the options.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Notifications">Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>You can show notifications for two kinds of things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Highlights</strong> - When a message in chat is highlighted</li>
        <li><strong>Stream Status</strong> - When a stream changes status, e.g.
        offline -> online or changed title</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For both these you can select separately if and when they are shown:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Off</strong> - Never show</li>
        <li><strong>When channel/app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab AND when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel or app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab OR when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When app not active</strong> - Only when the program doesn't
        have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab</li>
        <li><strong>When channel active</strong> - Only when the channel IS the
        currently selected tab</li>
        <li><strong>Always</strong> - No requirements, always show it</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In addition, the option <strong>Don't notify about "Stream offline"</strong> allows you
    to never show when a stream changes status to offline, so you will only be
    notified about streams going live or changing title/game.</p>
    
    <h3>Notification Type / Options</h3>
    <p>Select here whether to use the <em>Chatty Notifications</em> or the default
        <em>System Tray Notifications</em>. This settings DOES NOT enable or
    disable notifications altogether, just switch between the types.</p>
    <p>If you have <em>Chatty Notifications</em> selected, you can change some
    more options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Position:</strong> In which corner the the notification appears on the screen</li>
        <li><strong>Screen:</strong> On which screen the notification appears (<code>auto</code> means
        it's on the same screen as the Chatty window)</li>
        <li><strong>Display Time:</strong> How long the notification will be displayed
        by default. This can vary a bit depending on the situation.</li>
        <li><strong>No User Activity:</strong> This is a tricky one. If you enable
        this, then the notification will not be closed after the defined Display Time
        if no activity was detected in the last few seconds. This can be useful
        to still see notifications from a few minutes ago if you were away from
        the computer.
        The time defines
        when the notification will be closed no
        matter what, so older notifications won't stay there forever if you are
        away from the computer for a bit longer. 
        <br /><br />Activity is tracked through two methods: 
        The first method is tracking the system-wide mouse movements, which is
        done through an API that may not always return accurate information
        (e.g. if you are in a game) and it only checks the position every few
        seconds (only the last location is saved at any time for comparison).
        The second method detects activity only inside of Chatty, by tracking
        button presses and mouse actions (e.g. if you type a message, open a
        dialog etc.).</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Followed Streams</h3>
    <p>Enable this to make Chatty get a list of your followed streams regulary
    so it can display notifications if their status changes. This simpy allows
    Chatty to know about your followed streams, so notifications aren't the only
    advantage. It also allows it to record the viewer count and status history
    of followed live streams as long as Chatty is running.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Log_to_file">Log to file</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you enable logging, chat messages (and more if enabled) will be written
    into a seperate textfile for each channel.</p>
    <h3>Channels</h3>
    <p>You can specify which channels should be logged:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>always</strong> - Log all channels without exception <em>(default)</em></li>
        <li><strong>blacklist</strong> - Log all channels, except the ones on
        the blacklist</li>
        <li><strong>whitelist</strong> - Log no channels, except the ones on the
        whitelist</li>
        <li><strong>off</strong> - Log no channels whatsoever</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Messages Types</h3>
    <p>Normal chat messages are always logged, however you can log additional
    information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chat Info</strong> refers to general chat releated info messages
        like connecting/disconnecting/trying to timeout someone/stream title..</li>
        <li><strong>Bans/Timeouts</strong> refers to bans/timeouts in chat, which
            will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] BAN: name, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>Mod/Unmod</strong> refers to when someone in chat is modded/
            unmodded, which will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] MOD: name1, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>Joins/Parts</strong> refers to when someone joins/parts the
        channel, which will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] JOIN: name1, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>System Info</strong> means any info messages that are related
        more to Chatty than chat itself, like info about new versions, if you use
        settings commands..</li>
        <li><strong>Viewerstats</strong> are stats about the viewercount which
        are logged in a semi-regular interval to give some idea about the viewercount
        during that time. It shows which interval it refers to, the min/max/avg viewers,
        the number of values and the development (first value/after offline is absolute, then +-
        relative change, _ means offline before/in between/after that value, e.g.
        <code>[21:06:21] Viewerstats (21:03-21:06): avg:28.612 min:28.432 max:28.887 [3/28.519-87+455_]</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Viewercount</strong> will log the viewercount as it is updated,
            like this: <code>[15:23:58] VIEWERS: 12521</code></li>
    </ul>

                them the first time after starting Chatty).</li>

                <li><strong>Reopen dialogs from last session</strong>: Reopens
                any dialogs that were open when you closed Chatty last session
                and also puts them at the same position they were before.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Restore position only if on screen</strong>: If enabled,
            restores the position on start only if a large portion of the top of
            the dialog/window is visible on screen. This is to prevent dialogs
            from being lost off-screen by accident.</li>
        <li><strong>Attach dialogs position to main window</strong>: If enabled,
        moves the dialogs like Channel Info or Admin Dialog along with the
        main window, so they always keep the same relative position. You can
        still move the dialogs by themselves of course.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open URL Prompt</strong>: Enable this to be asked
            when opening a URL. Even if this is disabled, you may still asked on
            some occasions, but not for URLs in chat.</li>
        <li><strong>Always show chat scrollbar</strong>: Always show the vertical
        scrollbar in the chat window (there should never be a horizontal one),
        even if no scrolling is necessary. This can be useful for using window
        capture for streaming, because you can always keep the same subregion.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimize to tray</strong>: When minimizing the main Chatty
        window, it will be minimized to tray.</li>
        <li><strong>Close to tray</strong>: Closing the main Chatty window will
        not actually exit the program, but instead minimize it to tray. You can
        actually close the program via <code>Main - Exit</code> or the tray icon
        context menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Tab Order</strong>: Whether to show tabs in the order they
        were opened or alphabetically.</li>
        <li><strong>Scroll through tabs with mousewheel</strong>: Hover mouse
            over tabs and scroll to change tabs.</li>
        <li><strong>Default Userlist Width</strong>: The default width of the
            userlist in pixels.</li>
        <li><strong>Min. Width</strong>: The minimum width of the userlist in
            pixels.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Popout</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Restore location/size</strong>: When you close a popout
        window then it's location/size is saved and used for the next popout
        window that is opened. Each saved location/size is only used once, if
        there is none left then the default attributes are used. This is also
        saved between sessions (attributes of popouts that are open when you
        close Chatty are saved as well).</li>
        <li><strong>Close popout when only channel</strong>: When you have a
        channel popout window open and close the last channel in the main window,
        then the popout window will automatically be closed and the channel
        moved to the main window. Disable this if the popout shouldn't be closed
        automatically.</li>

        <a name="Commands">Commands</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Custom Commands</h3>
    <p>Custom commands allow you to specify aliases for anything you could also
    enter directly into the inputbox (like chat messages or regular commands),
    with the exception of other custom commands, which is a limitation
    implemented to prevent infinite loops. Custom commands you add should be in
    the following format:</p>
    
    <p><code>/&lt;commandName&gt; &lt;what the command should do&gt;</code></p>
    
    <p>Everything until the first space is the name of the comand, and everything
    after the first space is the text of the command. For example:</p>
    
    <p><code>/hello Hello World!</code></p>
    
    <p>If you added that to the custom commands and enter <code>/hello</code>
        in the inputbox, then it would send <code>Hello World!</code>, just as
    if you would have written it yourself and pressed Enter.</p>
    
    <h3>Custom Command Parameters</h3>
    <p>You can also specify parameters in the command text, which will be replaced
    when you execute the custom command. For example:</p>
    <p><code>/permit !permit $$1</code></p>
    <p>When you enter <code>/permit name</code>, then it will replace <code>$$1</code>
        with the first word after the command, which in this case would be
        <code>name</code>, making the actually send text <code>!permit name</code>.</p>
    
    <p>This is the syntax for specifying parameters (word in this context means
    anything seperated by a space):</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>$1, $2, $3</code></dt>
        <dd>First word, second word, third word etc.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>$1-</code></dt>
        <dd>First word, and all the words after it</dd>
        <dd>Equivalently <code>$2-, $3-</code> etc.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>$$1</code></dt>
        <dd>First word, but required, meaning the command result will only be
        send if all the required commands are actually there</dd>
        <dd>Equivalently <code>$$2, $$3-</code> is also possible</dd>
        
        <dt><code>\$1-</code></dt>
        <dd>Escape any special character (like <code>$</code>) by prepending a backslash
            <code>\</code>, which means this won't be interpreted as a parameter
        and not be replaced</dd>
        <dd>If you actually want to use <code>\</code>, you can escape the
            backslash itself, for example <code>\\$1-</code> will be replaced
            (leaving one backslash in front of the replaced parameter)</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3><a name="commands-parameters-predefined">Predefined Parameters</a></h3>
    <p>In a context other than entering the command in the inputbox, there are
    some predefined parameters. For example if you add a command as a context
    menu entry (see next section), then clicking that entry will execute the
    command while automatically adding an appropriate parameter.</p>
    
    <p>So you can for example add just <code>/Permit</code> to the menu, but
        the custom command <code>/permit !permit $$1</code> will actually be
    executed as <code>!permit &lt;name of the user&gt;</code>.</p>
    <table class="settings">
        <tr>
            <th>Context</th>
            <th>Parameters</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>All</em></td>
            <td><code>$chan</code> - the currently active channel (without leading #)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>User Context Menu</td>
            <td><code>$1</code> - name of the user</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>User Dialog</td>
            <td><code>$1</code> - name of the user</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Channel Context menu</td>
            <td><code>$1</code> - name of the currently active channel (without leading #)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hotkey</td>
            <td><code>$1</code> - the currently <a href="help.html#userselection">selected user</a> (if present)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>In addition, there is an implicit channel context, which means channel-aware
        commands like <code>/ban</code> are executed in the appropriate channel.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="commands-menu">Customize User/Channel Context Menu and User Dialog</a></h3>
    <p>You can add custom commands and regular commands to the <code>User Context Menu</code> (when you right-click
        on a user in chat), the <code>Channel Context Menu</code> (when you right-click anywhere on the chat
        that is not otherwise linked) and customize <code>User Dialog Buttons</code> (Custom Commands
        and Timeout Buttons).</p>
    <p>Commands can be added in the following format:</p>
    <p><code>/&lt;commandName1&gt;, /&lt;commandName2&gt;</code></p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p><code>/Slap, /Permit</code></p>
    <p>Which means the command with the name <code>slap</code> will be added
        first, then <code>permit</code> after that. You can use spaces,
        linebreaks and/or commas as seperators between commands.</p>
    
    <p>This is the syntax for specifying commands in the Context Menus/User Dialog:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>/Slap /Permit</code> or <code>Slap, Permit</code> or <code>Slap Permit</code></dt>
        <dd>Commands can be specified with or without forward slash <code>/</code>, then the name
        (without parameters) and space, linebreak or comma to seperate to the next command.</dd>
        <dd><em>Custom Commands in the User Dialog require the <code>/</code> in front.</em></dd>
        <dt><code>//Slap</code></dt>
        <dd>Prepending two forward slashes <code>//</code> will put the command
            in the special submenu <code>More..</code> (for Context Menus) or
            in a second line of buttons (for the User Dialog).</dd>
        <dt><code>| Slap</code> or <code>|//Slap</code></dt>
        <dd>Adding <code>|</code> (vertical bar) will add a seperator before the
            menu item for the next command.
            The <code>|</code> doesn't have to be directly in front of the command,
            it simply applies to the following command.</dd>
        <dd><em>Does not work for custom buttons in the User Dialog.</em></dd>
        <dt><code>/Set_color</code> is displayed as <code>Set color</code></dt>
        <dd>Underscores in command names are replaced with a space for display
        in a Context Menu or on a button.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>In addition, you can define for the <strong>User Dialog Buttons</strong>:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>5, 2m, 10m, 24h</code></dt>
        <dd>In addition to Custom Commands you can also specify Timeout Buttons
        in the User Dialog. Times are added just like Custom Commands
        (seperated by comma/space/linebreak). However they
        can only be added to the first row of buttons. They are interpreted as
        seconds by default, unless you add a suffix: <code>s</code> - seconds,
        <code>m</code> - minutes, <code>h</code> - hours, <code>d</code> - days.</dd>
        <dt><code>120s, 120</code> is displayed as <code>120s</code> and <code>2m</code></dt>
        <dd>Both definitions create a button with a 120 seconds timeout, however
            if you use a suffix, then the definition is used as button label
            directly, otherwise the label is automatically created based on the
            time.</dd>
        <dt><code>/Ban[B], /Unban[U], 2s[P]</code></dt>
        <dd>You can add keyboard shortcuts to buttons, that can be used while the
        dialog is open and focused. Add a single button in brackets (uppercase).
        Everything that is understood by
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/KeyStroke.html#getKeyStroke%28java.lang.String%29">getKeyStroke()</a>
        can be used. No spaces are allowed, however a plus (<code>+</code>) can
        be used instead (which will be replaced with a space automatically).</dd>
        <dt><code>/Slap[NUMPAD1|Np1], /Permit[NUMPAD2|]</code></dt>
        <dd>Adding a vertical bar (<code>|</code>) after the shortcut will use
        the text after it up to the closing bracket as label for the shortcut on the button (no
        spaces are allowed). If you don't specify any text, then no label is
        used for that shortcut.</dd>
        <dt><code>nokeylabels</code></dt>
        <dd>If that text appears anywhere in the definition, then no labels will
        be displayed on the buttons for the shortcuts, unless they are
        explicitly defined.</dd>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inform me about new versions</strong>: Checks for new
        versions every few days and outputs a message about it.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Unhost when your stream goes live</strong>: Automatically
            sends the <code>/unhost</code> command to your channel if you started
            your stream session in the last 15 minutes and the stream status
            changes (usually from offline -> live).<br />
            For this to work, you need to have joined the channel in Chatty,
            either with the broadcaster account (so your own account if it's
            your stream) or with an account that is an editor in the channel
            (in which case you also have to add the channel to the
            <code>autoUnhostStreams</code> setting, via
            <code>/add autoUnhostStreams &lt;streamName&gt;</code>, in order to
            tell Chatty that you are authorized/want to use the automatic <code>/unhost</code>
            feature in that channel).</li>
        <li><strong>Titlebar Addition</strong>: Prepend some arbitrary text to
            the window title. This can be useful if you run several instances of
            Chatty (to be able to tell them apart more easily).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Write Stream Status</h3>
    <p>You can let Chatty write information (title, game, viewercount) of a
        certain stream to a file. The file will be written to the subfolder <code>exported</code> of the settings directory
    (enter <code>/dir</code> to find out where that is). Stream information is
    only written if Chatty gets that data, so for it to work properly you need
    to currently have the channel of that stream open in Chatty. (When you change
    the setting, data will be requested once for testing, but you have to be in
    the channel for it to be updated regulary.)</p>
    
    <p>To save stream information to a file, you have to define it in the
    setting. Each line represents one stream/file and the content to write into
    the file. The format for each line is:</p>
    
    <p style="padding-left:10px;"><code>&lt;streamname&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [online/offline] &lt;content&gt;</code></p>
    
    <p>The optional parameter <code>online/offline</code> defines whether to
    write the given content to the file when the stream is online or offline. So
    you could for example define one line for online, which writes the viewercount
    and another for offline which writes "Offline" or maybe no content at all, which clears the file.
    If you only define one for online, then
    the file is not written if the stream is offline, so the previous info will
    stay in there. If you ommit this parameter, then online is assumed.</p>
    
    <p>The following codes in the content will be replaced with the appropriate data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>%title</code> - The title of the stream</li>
        <li><code>%game</code> - The game of the stream</li>
        <li><code>%viewers</code> - The current viewercount</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example which will write two files (if joined to #joshimuz):</p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
    <code>
        joshimuz title.txt %title (%viewers Viewers)<br />
        joshimuz title.txt offline Stream offline<br />
        joshimuz game.txt %game<br />
        joshimuz game.txt offline
    </code>
    </p>
    <p>If the stream is online, it writes the title and viewercount to <code>title.txt</code>
        and the game to <code>game.txt</code>.
    If the stream is offline it writes "Stream offline" to <code>title.txt</code> and empties
    <code>game.txt</code>.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>The server/port values are used when connecting, unless the commandline
        parameters <code>-server</code> and/or <code>-port</code> are used,
    then the value that is given there is used instead (without it being shown
    here). You should know if you set a server or port with a commandline
    parameter, but you can also check that by using <code>/get server</code>
    and <code>/get port</code>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular hotkeys</strong>, which will only trigger if the main Chatty

                    <li><strong>Application-wide hotkeys</strong>, which will trigger anywhere in
                    Chatty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global hotkeys</strong>, which are supposed to trigger everywhere
                    on your computer (Windows only, Hotkey version required). However some hotkeys may
                    not work, so just try it out.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With the <strong>Enable global hotkeys</strong> setting you
                can enable/disable the currently defined global hotkeys if your
                Chatty version supports global hotkeys. It does <em>not</em> do
                anything on it's own, it just toggles global hotkeys you defined
                on and off, in case you only need them sometimes and they
                interfer with other programs you use. You can also toggle that
                setting in the main menu under <code>Extra - Options</code> or
                use setting commands to change the <code>globalHotkeysEnabled</code>

                <h3>Adding/Editing hotkeys</h3>
                <p>When adding or changing a hotkey you have the following options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> The action to perform when the
                        hotkey is pressed. If you select <code>Custom Command</code>,
                        you have to enter the command to perform in the field below
                        (just the name of the command, see <a href="#Commands">Commands</a>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Hotkey:</strong> The key or key combination that
                    has to be pressed to perform the action, click into the field
                    and press the key or key combination you want to use.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the hotkey shows as being already used you may
                        still add it, but having more than one action defined
                        for the same hotkey will not trigger all the actions
                        when the hotkey is pressed, but a random one,
                        so it doesn't really make a lot of sense.
                        Adding it anyway can be sensible if you're currently
                        changing several hotkeys and will change the other
                        hotkey afterwards, so each key combination is only used
                        once.</li>

                    trigger anywhere on your computer (only works with the hotkey
                    version of Chatty and if it loaded properly, Windows only).</li></ul></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Delay:</strong> The delay between performed actions,
                        in 1/10th of a second,
                    if this is 0 then there will be no delay required, otherwise
                    specifying a delay of e.g. <code>50</code> will execute the
                    action only once per 5 seconds, even if you keep the hotkey
                    pressed. This can be useful for actions you normally would
                    only want to execute once (e.g. running a commercial,
                    sending a message to chat) and
                    that you don't want to spam by accident.</li>

                <p>TAB Completion allows you to write the beginning characters
                of a nickname in chat and then press TAB to complete it. To learn how to

                <h3>TAB Completion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show popup:</strong>
                    If enabled, shows a small window with information about the
                    current completion if there is more than one matching result.
                    It shows at which result of how many you are when cycling
                    through results as well as a limited overview of which results
                    there actually are.</li>
                    <li><strong>Max Items Shown:</strong> How many items
                        (e.g. names that match what you entered) to show
                    in the popup at once. You can set this to 0 to not show any
                    items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete to common prefix</strong>:
                        Pressing TAB only completes up to the common prefix for
                        all found matches, giving you the opportunity to add
                        more characters and then press TAB again to refine the
                        results or just press TAB again to start cycling through
                        the results.
                        <br /><br />
                    With this
                    setting disabled, it immediately completes the first found
                    result, allowing you to directly cycle through by pressing TAB repeatedly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Changes how the matching usernames
                        are sorted for completion (only applies to usernames,
                        not for other stuff like emotes or setting names which
                        are always alphabetical).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Predictive: Gives names of users that were recently
                            active in chat higher priority, with users who send
                            a message that was highlighted the highest. This way
                            people you talk to probably appear under the first
                            few results.</li>
                            <li>Alphabetical: Sort names alphabetical.</li>
                            <li>Userlist: Sort names the same as in the userlist.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                </ul>
                
                    <h3><a name="Completion-custom">Custom Completion Items</a></h3>
                <p>Custom Completion allows you to add terms and their completion,
                    allowing you to not only complete names in chat (<kbd>TAB</kbd>) or emotes
                (<kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd>) but also custom stuff you added to the list by prepending the term with a
                point and using <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd>.</p>
                
                <p>Example: Add <code>chatty</code> as <em>Key</em> and
                    <code>http://chatty.github.io</code> as <em>Value</em>
                    and then in the inputbox type <code>.chatty</code> (notice the dot in front) and press
                    <kbd>Shift-TAB</kbd> to complete it to the URL.</p>
                
                <p>Custom Completion items can only have one completion, so you
                    can't have <code>.chatty</code> complete to several things
                    as it could be the case with a nickname.</p>
                
                <p>Besides the Settings Dialog, you can also use the
                    <code>/customCompletion</code> command to modify custom
                completion items:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><code>/customCompletion add &lt;item&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - Add an item</li>
                    <li><code>/customCompletion set &lt;item&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - Change an item that already exists</li>
                    <li><code>/customCompletion remove &lt;item&gt;</code> - Remove an item</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Remember that you can also use TAB Completion for commands. Kappab</p>
